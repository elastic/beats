IMPORTANT: This documentation is placeholder content. It has not yet been reviewed.

Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've completed the
<<{beatname_lc}-configuration,configuration steps>> in the Getting Started.
This section describes some common use cases for changing configuration options.

To configure {beatname_uc}, you edit the configuration file. For rpm and deb,
youâ€™ll find the configuration file at +/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.yml+.
There's also a full example configuration file at
+/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.reference.yml+ that shows all non-deprecated
options. For mac and win, look in the archive that you extracted.

The {beatname_uc} configuration file uses http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax.
See the {libbeat}/config-file-format.html[Config File Format] section of the
_{libbeat_docs}_ for more about the structure of the config file.
