[id="{beatname_lc}-configuration"]
=== Step 2: Configure {beatname_uc}

Before running {beatname_uc}, you can specify the location of the systemd
journal files and configure how you want the files to be read. If you accept the
default configuration, {beatname_uc} reads from the local journal.

include::{libbeat-dir}/docs/shared-configuring.asciidoc[]

Here is a sample of the +{beatname_lc}+ section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ file.
{beatname_uc} uses predefined default values for most configuration options.

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
journalbeat.inputs:
- paths: ["/path/to/journal/directory"]
  seek: head
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To configure {beatname_uc}:

. Specify a list of paths to your systemd journal files. Each path can be a
directory path (to collect events from all journals in a directory), or a file
path. For example:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- paths:
  - "/dev/log"
  - "/var/log/messages/my-journal-file.journal"
----
+
If no paths are specified, {beatname_uc} reads from the default journal.

. Set the <<{beatname_lc}-seek,`seek`>> option to control the position where
{beatname_uc} starts reading the journal. The available options are `head`,
`tail`, and `cursor`. The default is `cursor`, which means that on first read,
{beatname_uc} starts reading at the beginning of the file, but continues reading
at the last known position after a reload or restart. For more detail about
the settings, see the reference docs for the
<<{beatname_lc}-seek,`seek` option>>. 

. (Optional) Set the <<{beatname_lc}-include-matches,`include_matches`>> option
to filter entries in journald before collecting any log events. This reduces the
number of events that {beatname_uc} needs to process. For example, to fetch only
Redis events from a Docker container tagged as `redis`, use: 
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- paths: []
  include_matches:
    - "CONTAINER_TAG=redis"
    - "_COMM=redis"

=== Step 3: Load the index template in Elasticsearch

[id="{beatname_lc}-starting"]
=== Step 5: Start {beatname_uc}

Start {beatname_uc} by issuing the appropriate command for your platform. If you
are accessing a secured Elasticsearch cluster, make sure you've configured
credentials as described in <<{beatname_lc}-configuration>>.

NOTE: If you use an init.d script to start {beatname_uc} on deb or rpm, you can't
specify command line flags (see <<command-line-options>>). To specify flags,
start {beatname_uc} in the foreground.

*deb and rpm:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo service {beatname_lc} start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*linux:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo chown root {beatname_lc}.yml <1>
sudo ./{beatname_lc} -e
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> You'll be running {beatname_uc} as root, so you need to change ownership
of the configuration file, or run {beatname_uc} with `--strict.perms=false`
specified. See
{beats-ref}/config-file-permissions.html[Config File Ownership and Permissions]
in the _Beats Platform Reference_.

{beatname_uc} is now ready to send journal events to the defined output.

[[view-kibana-dashboards]]
=== Step 6: View the sample Kibana dashboards

To make it easier for you to visualize your log data, we have created example
{beatname_uc} dashboards. You loaded the dashboards earlier when you ran the
`setup` command.

include::../../libbeat/docs/opendashboards.asciidoc[]

The dashboards are provided as examples. We recommend that you
{kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[customize] them to meet your needs.

[NOTE]
=====
You can also use the {infra-guide}/logs-ui-overview.html[Logs UI] in {kib} to
tail logs in real time. By default, however, the Logs UI only shows logs from
`filebeat-*` indexes. To show {beatname_uc} indexes, add the following settings
to the {kib} configuration: 

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.infra:
 sources:
   default:
     logAlias: "filebeat-*,journalbeat-*"
