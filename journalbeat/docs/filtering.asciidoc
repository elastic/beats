== Filter and enhance the exported data

Your use case might require only a subset of the data exported by {beatname_uc},
or you might need to enhance the exported data (for example, by adding
metadata). {beatname_uc} provides a couple of options for filtering and
enhancing exported data.

You can configure {beatname_uc} to include events that match specific filtering
criteria. To do this, use the <<include-matches,`include_matches`>>
option. The advantage of this approach is that you can reduce the number of
fields that {beatname_uc} needs to process.

Another approach (the one described here) is to define processors to configure
global processing across all data exported by {beatname_uc}.

=== Processors

include::{libbeat-dir}/processors.asciidoc[]

// You must set the processor-scope attribute to resolve the attribute reference
// defined in processors-using.asciidoc. The attribute is used to indicate where
// processors are valid. If processors are valid in more than two locations
// (root and :processor-scope:), you need to add a conditionally coded section
// to processors-using.asciidoc.
