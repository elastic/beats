### PacketBeats Agent configuration file.

### PacketBeats is an application performance monitoring service that
### works by sniffing the network traffic between your application
### components. Go to http://{account}.packetbeats.com

[interfaces]
# Select on which network interfaces to sniff. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
device = "en0"

# Configure which protocols to monitor and on which ports are they
# running. You can disable a given protocol by commenting out its
# configuration.

[agent]

# defined, we will just use the hostname.

# Set the host and port where to find ElasticSearch.

[runoptions]
# The PacketBeats agent can drop privileges after creating the sniffing
# socket. Root access is required for opening the socket but everything
# else requires no privileges. Therefore, it is strongly recommended
# to have the Agent switch users after the initialization phase.
# The following two settings set the User Id and the Group Id under 
# which the Agent will run.
# Warning: Because on Linux Setuid doesn't change the uid of all threads,
# the Go garbage collector will continue to run as root.
#uid=501
#gid=501
