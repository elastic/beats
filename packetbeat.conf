### Packetbeat Agent configuration file.
###
### Packetbeat is a protocol monitoring service that
### works by sniffing the network traffic between your application
### components. It dumps the results into Elasticsearch.

[output]
# Select the type of outputs where Packetbeat dumps the transactions
# in a JSON format
  # Uncomment the following lines to enable Elasticsearch as output 
  [output.elasticsearch]
    # Set the host and port where to find Elasticsearch.
    host = "localhost"

    # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials
    # protocol = "https"
    # username = "admin"

    # Optional index name and HTTP path
    # index = "packetbeat"

    # Set the host and port where to find Redis.
    host = "localhost"
    port = 6379

    # Optional index name
    # index = "packetbeat"

[interfaces]
# Select on which network interfaces to sniff. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
device = "any"

[protocols]
# Configure which protocols to monitor and on which ports are they
# running. You can disable a given protocol by commenting out its
# configuration.
  [protocols.http]
  ports = [80, 8080, 8000, 5000, 8002]

  [protocols.mysql]
  ports = [3306]

  [protocols.redis]
  ports = [6379]

  [protocols.pgsql]
  ports = [5432]

[procs]
# Uncomment the following line to disable the process monitoring.
# dont_read_from_proc = true

# Which processes to monitor and how to find them. The processes can
# be found by searching their command line by a given string.
  [procs.monitored.mysqld]

[agent]
# The name of the agent as it will show up in the web interface. If not
# defined, we will just use the hostname.
#
#name=

# Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
# by the server on which the agent is installed. This option is useful
# to remove duplicates if agents are installed on multiple servers.
#ignore_outgoing = true

# How often (in seconds) agents are publishing their IPs to the topology map.
# By default is 10 seconds.
# refresh_topology_freq = 10

# Expiration time (in seconds) of the IPs published by an agent to the topology map. 
# All the IPs will be deleted afterwards. Note, that the value must be higher than
# refresh_topology_freq. By default is 15 seconds.
# topology_expire = 15

[runoptions]
# The Packetbeat agent can drop privileges after creating the sniffing
# socket. Root access is required for opening the socket but everything
# else requires no privileges. Therefore, it is strongly recommended
# to have the Agent switch users after the initialization phase.
# The following two settings set the User Id and the Group Id under
# which the Agent will run.
# Warning: Because on Linux Setuid doesn't change the uid of all threads,
# the Go garbage collector will continue to run as root.
# Note: Process monitoring only works when running as root.
#uid=501
#gid=501

[passwords]
# Uncomment the following to hide certain parameters from HTTP POST
# requests. The value of the parameters will be replaced with '*' characters
# This is generally useful for avoiding storing user passwords or other
# sensitive information.
#hide_keywords = ["pass=", "password=", "passwd=", "Password="]
