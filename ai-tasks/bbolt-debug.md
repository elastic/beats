# Goal
- Add a very simple, read-only web interface as part of Filebeat to list all keys in the bbolt registry
- Add pagination with a default page size of 50
- Add a configuration option registry.debug_port that defaults to 8000
- It should use share the DB object from the store defined
  @libbeat/statestore/backend/bbolt
- Expose the bbolt.DB as needed
- Properly render the data generated by the filestream input @filebeat/input/filestream
- Use data/registry/filebeat.db as an example
