beta[]

The Benchmark input generates generic events and sends them to the output. This can be useful when you want to benchmark the difference between outputs or output settings.

Example configurations:

Basic example, infinite events as quickly as possible:
["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: benchmark
  enabled: true
  message: "test message"
  threads: 1
----

Send 1024 events and stop example:
["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: benchmark
  enabled: true
  message: "test message"
  threads: 1
  count: 1024
----

Send 5 events per second example:
["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: benchmark
  enabled: true
  message: "test message"
  threads: 1
  eps: 5
----

==== Configuration options

The Benchmark input supports the following configuration options plus the
<<{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-common-options>> described later.

[float]
==== `message`

This is the value that will be in the `message` field of the json document.

[float]
==== `threads`

This is the number of goroutines that will be started generating messages. Normally 1 thread can saturate an output but if necessary this can be increased.

[float]
==== `count`

This is the number of messages to send. 0 represents sending infinite messages. This is mutually exclusive with the `eps` option.

[float]
==== `eps`

This is the number of events per second to send. 0 represents sending as quickly as possible. This is mutually exclusive with the `count` option.


[float]
=== Metrics

This input exposes metrics under the <<http-endpoint, HTTP monitoring endpoint>>.
These metrics are exposed under the `/inputs` path. They can be used to
observe the activity of the input.

[options="header"]
|=======
| Metric                    | Description
| `events_published_total`  | Number of events published.
| `publishing_time`         | Histogram of the elapsed in nanoseconds (time of publisher.Publish).
