=== AWS S3 input

++++
<titleabbrev>AWS S3</titleabbrev>
++++

Use the `aws-s3` input to retrieve logs from S3 objects that are pointed to by
S3 notification events read from an SQS queue or directly polling list of S3 objects in an S3 bucket.
The use of SQS notification is preferred: polling list of S3 objects is expensive
in terms of performance and costs and should be preferably used only when no SQS
notification can be attached to the S3 buckets. This input can, for example, be
used to receive S3 access logs to monitor detailed records for the requests that
are made to a bucket. This input also supports S3 notification from SNS to SQS.

SQS notification method is enabled setting `queue_url` configuration value.
S3 bucket list polling method is enabled setting `bucket_arn` configuration value.
Both value cannot be set at the same time, at least one of the two value must be set.

When using the SQS notification method this input depends on S3 notifications delivered
to an SQS queue for `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events. You must create an SQS queue and configure S3
to publish events to the queue.

When processing a S3 object which pointed by a SQS message, if half of the set
visibility timeout passed and the processing is still ongoing, then the
visibility timeout of that SQS message will be reset to make sure the message
does not go back to the queue in the middle of the processing. If there are
errors happening during the processing of the S3 object, then the process will
be stopped and the SQS message will be returned back to the queue.

  expand_event_list_from_field: Records
----


When using the direct polling list of S3 objects in an S3 buckets,
a number of workers that will process the S3 objects listed must be set
through the `number_of_workers` config.
Listing of the S3 bucket will be polled according the time interval defined by
`bucket_list_interval` config. Default value is 120secs.

  expand_event_list_from_field: Records
----


The `aws-s3` input can also poll 3rd party S3 compatible services such as the self hosted Minio.
Using non-AWS S3 compatible buckets requires the use of `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` for authentication.
To specify the S3 bucket name, use the `non_aws_bucket_name` config and the `endpoint` must be set to replace the default API endpoint.
`endpoint` should be a full URI in the form of `https(s)://<s3 endpoint>` in the case of `non_aws_bucket_name`, that will be used as the API endpoint of the service.
No `endpoint` is needed if using the native AWS S3 service hosted at `amazonaws.com`.
Please see <<aws-credentials-config,Configuration parameters>> for alternate AWS domains that require a different endpoint.

The `aws-s3` input supports the following configuration options plus the
<<{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-common-options>> described later.

[float]
==== `api_timeout`

The maximum duration of the AWS API call. If it exceeds the timeout, the AWS API
call will be interrupted. The default AWS API timeout is `120s`.

The API timeout must be longer than the `sqs.wait_time` value.

[id="input-{type}-buffer_size"]
[float]
==== `buffer_size`

The size in bytes of the buffer that each harvester uses when fetching a file.
This only applies to non-JSON logs. The default is `16 KiB`.

[id="input-{type}-content_type"]
[float]
==== `content_type`

A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.  This
can be set to override the MIME type that was given to the object when
it was uploaded. For example: `application/json`.

[id="input-{type}-encoding"]
[float]
==== `encoding`

The file encoding to use for reading data that contains international
characters. This only applies to non-JSON logs. See <<_encoding_3>>.


[float]
==== `expand_event_list_from_field`

If the fileset using this input expects to receive multiple messages bundled
under a specific field then the config option `expand_event_list_from_field`
value can be assigned the name of the field. This setting will be able to split
the messages under the group value into separate events. For example, CloudTrail
logs are in JSON format and events are found under the JSON object "Records".

["source","json"]
----
{
    "Records": [
        {
            "eventVersion": "1.07",
            "eventTime": "2019-11-14T00:51:00Z",
            "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
            "eventID": "EXAMPLE8-9621-4d00-b913-beca2EXAMPLE",
        },
        {
            "eventVersion": "1.07",
            "eventTime": "2019-11-14T00:52:00Z",
            "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
            "eventID": "EXAMPLEc-28be-486c-8928-49ce6EXAMPLE",
        }
    ]
}
----

Note: When `expand_event_list_from_field` parameter is given in the config,
aws-s3 input will assume the logs are in JSON format and decode them as JSON.
Content type will not be checked. If a file has "application/json" content-type,
`expand_event_list_from_field` becomes required to read the JSON file.

[float]
==== `file_selectors`

If the SQS queue will have events that correspond to files that
{beatname_uc} shouldn't process `file_selectors` can be used to limit
the files that are downloaded.  This is a list of selectors which are
made up of `regex` and `expand_event_list_from_field` options.  The
`regex` should match the S3 object key in the SQS message, and the
optional `expand_event_list_from_field` is the same as the global
setting.  If `file_selectors` is given, then any global
`expand_event_list_from_field` value is ignored in favor of the ones
specified in the `file_selectors`.  Regex syntax is the same as the Go
language.  Files that don't match one of the regexes won't be
processed.  <<input-aws-s3-content_type>>, <<input-aws-s3-parsers>>,
<<input-aws-s3-include_s3_metadata>>,<<input-aws-s3-max_bytes>>,
<<input-aws-s3-buffer_size>>, and <<input-aws-s3-encoding>> may also
be set for each file selector.

["source", "yml"]
----
file_selectors:
  - regex: '/CloudTrail/'
    expand_event_list_from_field: 'Records'
  - regex: '/CloudTrail-Digest/'
  - regex: '/CloudTrail-Insight/'
    expand_event_list_from_field: 'Records'
----

[float]
==== `fips_enabled`

Moved to <<aws-credentials-config,AWS credentials options>>.

[id="input-{type}-include_s3_metadata"]
[float]
==== `include_s3_metadata`

This input can include S3 object metadata in the generated events for use in
follow-on processing. You must specify the list of keys to include. By default
none are included. If the key exists in the S3 response then it will be included
in the event as `aws.s3.metadata.<key>` where the key name as been normalized
to all lowercase.

----
include_s3_metadata:
  - last-modified
  - x-amz-version-id
----

[id="input-{type}-max_bytes"]
[float]
==== `max_bytes`

The maximum number of bytes that a single log message can have. All bytes after
`max_bytes` are discarded and not sent. This setting is especially useful for
multiline log messages, which can get large. This only applies to non-JSON logs.
The default is `10 MiB`.

[float]
==== `max_number_of_messages`

The maximum number of SQS messages that can be inflight at any time. Defaults
to 5.

[id="input-{type}-parsers"]
[float]
==== `parsers`

beta[]

This option expects a list of parsers that non-JSON logs go through.

Available parsers:

* `multiline`

In this example, {beatname_uc} is reading multiline messages that
consist of XML that start with the `<Event>` tag.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: {type}
  ...
  parsers:
    - multiline:
        pattern: "^<Event"
        negate:  true
        match:   after
----

See the available parser settings in detail below.

[float]
===== `multiline`

beta[]

Options that control how {beatname_uc} deals with log messages that span
multiple lines. See <<multiline-examples>> for more information about
configuring multiline options.

[float]
==== `queue_url`

URL of the AWS SQS queue that messages will be received from. (Required when `bucket_arn` and `non_aws_bucket_name` are not set).

[float]
==== `visibility_timeout`

The duration that the received SQS messages are hidden from subsequent retrieve
requests after being retrieved by a `ReceiveMessage` request. The default
visibility timeout is `300s`. The maximum is `12h`. {beatname_uc} will
automatically reset the visibility timeout of a message after 1/2 of the
duration passes to prevent a message that is still being processed from
returning to the queue.

[float]
==== `sqs.max_receive_count`

The maximum number of times a SQS message should be received (retried) before
deleting it. This feature prevents poison-pill messages (messages that can be
received but can't be processed) from consuming resources. The number of times
a message has been received is tracked using the `ApproximateReceiveCount` SQS
attribute. The default value is 5.

If you have configured a dead letter queue then you can set this value to
`-1` to disable deletion on failure.

[float]
==== `sqs.notification_parsing_script.source`

Inline Javascript source code.

[source,yaml]
----
sqs.notification_parsing_script.source: >
  function parse(notification) {
      var evts = [];
      var evt = new S3EventV2();
      evt.SetS3BucketName(notification.bucket);
      evt.SetS3ObjectKey(notification.path);
      evts.push(evt);
      return evts;
  }
----

[float]
==== `sqs.notification_parsing_script.file`

Path to a script file to load. Relative paths are interpreted as
relative to the `path.config` directory. Globs are expanded.

This loads `filter.js` from disk.

[source,yaml]
----
sqs.notification_parsing_script.file: ${path.config}/filter.js
----

[float]
==== `sqs.notification_parsing_script.files`

List of script files to load. The scripts are concatenated together.
Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the `path.config` directory.
And globs are expanded.

[float]
==== `sqs.notification_parsing_script.params`

A dictionary of parameters that are passed to the `register` of the
script.

Parameters can be passed to the script by adding `params` to the config.
This allows for a script to be made reusable. When using `params` the
code must define a `register(params)` function to receive the parameters.

[source,yaml]
----
sqs.notification_parsing_script:
  params:
    provider: aws:s3
  source: >
    var params = {provider: ""};
    function register(scriptParams) {
      params = scriptParams;
    }
    function parse(notification) {
      var evts = [];
      var evt = new S3EventV2();
      evt.SetS3BucketName(notification.bucket);
      evt.SetS3ObjectKey(notification.path);
      evt.SetProvider(params.provider);
      evts.push(evt);
      return evts;
    }
----

[float]
==== `sqs.notification_parsing_script.timeout`

This sets an execution timeout for the `process` function. When
the `process` function takes longer than the `timeout` period the function
is interrupted. You can set this option to prevent a script from running for
too long (like preventing an infinite `while` loop). By default there is no
timeout.

[float]
==== `sqs.notification_parsing_script.max_cached_sessions`

This sets the maximum number of Javascript VM sessions
that will be cached to avoid reallocation.

[float]
==== `sqs.wait_time`

The maximum duration that an SQS `ReceiveMessage` call should wait for a message
to arrive in the queue before returning. The default value is `20s`. The maximum
value is `20s`.

[float]
==== `bucket_arn`

ARN of the AWS S3 bucket that will be polled for list operation. (Required when `queue_url` and `non_aws_bucket_name` are not set).

[float]
==== `non_aws_bucket_name`

Name of the S3 bucket that will be polled for list operation. Required for 3rd party S3 compatible services. (Required when `queue_url` and `bucket_arn` are not set).

[float]
==== `bucket_list_interval`

Time interval for polling listing of the S3 bucket: default to `120s`.

[float]
==== `bucket_list_prefix`

Prefix to apply for the list request to the S3 bucket. Default empty.

[float]
==== `number_of_workers`

Number of workers that will process the S3 objects listed. (Required when `bucket_arn` is set).


[float]
==== `provider`

Name of the 3rd party S3 bucket provider like backblaze or GCP.
The following endpoints/providers will be detected automatically:
|===
|Domain |Provider
|amazonaws.com, amazonaws.com.cn, c2s.sgov.gov, c2s.ic.gov |aws
|backblazeb2.com |backblaze
|wasabisys.com |wasabi

|exo.io |exoscale
|upcloudobjects.com |upcloud
|ilandcloud.com |iland
|zadarazios.com |zadara
|===


[float]
==== `path_style`

Enabling this option sets the bucket name as a path in the API call instead of a subdomain. When enabled
https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.<provider>.com becomes https://s3.<region>.<provider>.com/<bucket-name>.
This is only supported with 3rd party S3 providers.  AWS does not support path style.


[float]
==== `aws credentials`

In order to make AWS API calls, `aws-s3` input requires AWS credentials. Please
see <<aws-credentials-config,AWS credentials options>> for more details.

[float]
==== `backup_to_bucket_arn`

The bucket ARN to backup processed files to. This will copy the processed file after it was fully read.
When using the `non_aws_bucket_name`, please use `non_aws_backup_to_bucket_name` accordingly.

Naming of the backed up files can be controlled with `backup_to_bucket_prefix`.

[float]
==== `backup_to_bucket_prefix`

This prefix will be prepended to the object key when backing it up to another (or the same) bucket.

[float]
==== `non_aws_backup_to_bucket_name`

The bucket name to backup processed files to. Use this parameter when not using AWS buckets. This will copy the processed file after it was fully read.
When using the `bucket_arn`, please use `backup_to_bucket_arn` accordingly.

Naming of the backed up files can be controlled with `backup_to_bucket_prefix`.

[float]
==== `delete_after_backup`

Controls whether fully processed files will be deleted from the bucket.

Can only be used together with the backup functionality.

[float]
=== AWS Permissions

Specific AWS permissions are required for IAM user to access SQS and S3
when using the SQS notifications method:

----
s3:GetObject
sqs:ReceiveMessage
sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility
sqs:DeleteMessage
----

Reduced specific S3 AWS permissions are required for IAM user to access S3
when using the polling list of S3 bucket objects:

----
s3:GetObject
s3:ListBucket
s3:GetBucketLocation
----

In case `backup_to_bucket_arn` or `non_aws_backup_to_bucket_name` are set the following permission is required as well:
----
s3:PutObject
----

In case `delete_after_backup` is set the following permission is required as well:
----
s3:DeleteObject
----

In case optional SQS metric `sqs_messages_waiting_gauge` is desired, the following permission is required:
----
sqs:GetQueueAttributes
----

[float]
=== S3 and SQS setup

Enable bucket notification: any new object creation in S3 bucket will also
create a notification through SQS. Please see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html#step1-create-sqs-queue-for-notification[create-sqs-queue-for-notification]
for more details.

[float]
=== S3 -> SNS -> SQS setup
If you would like to use the bucket notification in multiple different consumers
(others than {beatname_lc}), you should use an SNS topic for the bucket notification.
Please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html#step1-create-sns-topic-for-notification[create-SNS-topic-for-notification]
for more details. SQS queue will be configured as a
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sqs-as-subscriber.html[subscriber to the SNS topic].

[float]
=== Parallel Processing

When using the SQS notifications method, multiple {beatname_uc} instances can read from the same SQS queues at the same time.
To horizontally scale processing when there are large amounts of log data
flowing into an S3 bucket, you can run multiple {beatname_uc} instances that
read from the same SQS queues at the same time. No additional configuration is
required.

Using SQS ensures that each message in the queue is processed only once even
when multiple {beatname_uc} instances are running in parallel. To prevent
{beatname_uc} from receiving and processing the message more than once, set the
visibility timeout.

The visibility timeout begins when SQS returns a message to {beatname_uc}. During
this time, {beatname_uc} processes and deletes the message. However, if {beatname_uc}
fails before deleting the message and your system doesn't call the DeleteMessage
action for that message before the visibility timeout expires, the message
becomes visible to other {beatname_uc} instances, and the message is received
again. By default, the visibility timeout is set to 5 minutes for aws-s3 input
in {beatname_uc}. 5 minutes is sufficient time for {beatname_uc} to read SQS
messages and process related s3 log files.

When using the polling list of S3 bucket objects method be aware that if running multiple {beatname_uc} instances,
they can list the same S3 bucket at the same time. Since the state of the ingested S3 objects is persisted
(upon processing a single list operation) in the `path.data` configuration
and multiple {beatname_uc} cannot share the same `path.data` this will produce repeated
ingestion of the S3 object.
Therefore, when using the polling list of S3 bucket objects method, scaling should be
vertical, with a single bigger {beatname_uc} instance and higher `number_of_workers`
config value.

[float]
=== SQS Custom Notification Parsing Script

Under some circumstances you might want to listen to events that are not following
the standard SQS notifications format. To be able to parse them, it is possible to
define a custom script that will take care of processing them and generating the
required list of S3 Events used to download the files.

The `sqs.notification_parsing_script` executes Javascript code to process an event.
It uses a pure Go implementation of ECMAScript 5.1 and has no external dependencies.

It can be configured by embedding Javascript in your configuration file or by pointing
the processor at external file(s). Only one of the options `sqs.notification_parsing_script.source`, `sqs.notification_parsing_script.file`, and `sqs.notification_parsing_script.files`
can be set at the same time.

The script requires a `parse(notification)` function that receives the notification as
a raw string and returns a list of `S3EventV2` objects. This raw string can then be
processed as needed, e.g.: `JSON.parse(n)` or the provided helper for XML `new XMLDecoder(n)`.

If the script defines a `test()` function it will be invoked when it is loaded. Any exceptions thrown will cause the processor to fail to load. This can be used to make assertions about the behavior of the script.

[source,javascript]
----
function parse(n) {
  var m = JSON.parse(n);
  var evts = [];
  var files = m.files;
  var bucket = m.bucket;

  if (!Array.isArray(files) || (files.length == 0) || bucket == null || bucket == "") {
    return evts;
  }

  files.forEach(function(f){
    var evt = new S3EventV2();
    evt.SetS3BucketName(bucket);
    evt.SetS3ObjectKey(f.path);
    evts.push(evt);
  });

  return evts;
}

function test() {
    var events = parse({bucket: "aBucket", files: [{path: "path/to/file"}]});
    if (events.length !== 1) {
      throw "expecting one event";
    }
    if (events[0].S3.Bucket.Name === "aBucket") {
        throw "expected bucket === aBucket";
    }
    if (events[0].S3.Object.Key === "path/to/file") {
        throw "expected bucket === path/to/file";
    }
}
