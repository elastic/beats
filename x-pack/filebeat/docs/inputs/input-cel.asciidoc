=== Common Expression Language input

++++
<titleabbrev>CEL</titleabbrev>
++++

Use the `cel` input to read messages from a file path or HTTP API with a variety of payloads using the https://opensource.google.com/projects/cel[Common Expression Language (CEL)] and the https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/elastic/mito/lib[mito] CEL extension libraries.

CEL is a non-Turing complete language that can perform evaluation of expression in inputs, which can include file and API endpoints using the mito extension library.
The `cel` input periodically runs a CEL program that is given an execution environment that may be configured by the user, and publishes the set of events that result from the program evaluation.
Optionally the CEL program may return cursor states that will be provided to the next execution of the CEL program.
The cursor states may be used to control the behaviour of the program.

This input supports:

* Auth
** Basic
** Digest
** OAuth2
* Retrieval at a configurable interval
* Pagination
* Retries
* Rate limiting
* Proxying

Example configurations:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
# Fetch your public IP every minute.
- type: cel
  interval: 1m
  resource.url: https://api.ipify.org/?format=json
  program: |
    bytes(get(state.url).Body).as(body, {
        "events": [body.decode_json()]
    })
----

or equivalently using the text format from ipify.org

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
# Fetch your public IP every minute.
- type: cel
  interval: 1m
  resource.url: https://api.ipify.org/?format=text
  program: |
    {
        "events": [{"ip": string(get(state.url).Body)}]
    }
----

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
- type: cel
  resource.url: http://localhost:9200/_search
  state:
    scroll: 5m
  program: |
    (
        !has(state.cursor) || !has(state.cursor.scroll_id) ?
            post(state.url+"?scroll=5m", "", "")
        :
            post(
                state.url+"/scroll?"+{"scroll_id": [state.cursor.scroll_id]}.format_query(),
                "application/json",
                {"scroll": state.scroll}.encode_json()
            )
    ).as(resp, bytes(resp.Body).decode_json().as(body, {
            "events": body.hits.hits,
            "cursor": {"scroll_id": body._scroll_id},
    }))
----


==== Execution

The execution environment provided for the input includes includes the functions, macros, and global variables provided by the mito library.
A single JSON object is provided as an input accessible through a `state` variable.
`state` contains a string `url` field and may contain arbitrary other fields configured via the input's `state` configuration.
If the CEL program saves cursor states between executions of the program, the configured `state.cursor` value will be replaced by the saved cursor prior to execution.

On start the `state` is will be something like this:

["source","json",subs="attributes"]
----
{
    "url": <resource address>,
    "cursor": { ... },
    ...
}
----

The `state.url` field will be present and may be an HTTP end-point or a file path.
It is the responsibility of the CEL program to handle removing the scheme from a file URL if it is present.
The `state.url` field may be mutated during execution of the program, but the mutated state will not be persisted between restarts The `state.url` field must be present in the returned value to ensure that it is available in the next evaluation unless the program has the resource address hard-coded in or it is available from the cursor.

Additional fields may be present at the root of the object and if the program tolerates it, the cursor value may be absent.
Only the cursor is persisted over restarts, but all fields in state are retained between iterations of the processing loop except for the produced events array, see below.

If the cursor is present the program should perform and process requests based on its value.
If cursor is not present the program must have alternative logic to determine what requests to make.

After completion of a program's execution it should return a single object with a structure looking like this:

["source","json",subs="attributes"]
----
{
    "events": [ <1>
        {...},
        ...
    ],
    "cursor": [ <2>
        {...},
        ...
    ],
    "url": <resource address>,
    "status_code": <HTTP request status code if a network request>,
    "header": <HTTP response headers if a network request>,
    "rate_limit": <HTTP rate limit map if required by API>, <3>
    "want_more": false <4>
}
----

<1> The `events` field must be present, but may be empty or null. If it is not empty, it must only have objects as elements.
The field should be an array, but in the case of an error condition in the CEL program it is acceptable to return a single object instead of an array; this will will be wrapped as an array for publication and an error will be logged.

<2> If `cursor` is present it must be either be a single object or an array with the same length as events; each element _i_ of the `cursor` will be the details for obtaining the events at and beyond event _i_ in the `events` array. If the `cursor` is a single object it is will be the details for obtaining events after the last event in the `events` array and will only be retained on successful publication of all the events in the `events` array.

<3> If `rate_limit` is present it must be a map with numeric fields `rate` and `burst`. The `rate_limit` field may also have a string `error` field and other fields which will be logged. If it has an `error` field, the `rate` and `burst` will not be used to set rate limit behavior. The {mito_docs}/lib#Limit[Limit], and {mito_docs}/lib#OktaRateLimit[Okta Rate Limit policy] and {mito_docs}/lib#DraftRateLimit[Draft Rate Limit policy] documentation show how to construct this field.

<4> The evaluation is repeated with the new state, after removing the events field, if the "want_more" field is present and true, and a non-zero events array is returned. If the "want_more" field is present after a failed evaluation, it is set to false.

The `status_code`, `header` and `rate_limit` values may be omitted if the program is not interacting with an HTTP API end-point and so will not be needed to contribute to program control.

==== Debug state logging

The CEL input will log the complete state after evaluation when logging at the DEBUG level.
This will include any sensitive or secret information kept in the `state` object, and so DEBUG level logging should not be used in production when sensitive information is retained in the `state` object.
See <<cel-state-redact,`redact`>> configuration parameters for settings to exclude sensitive fields from DEBUG logs.


==== CEL extension libraries

As noted above the `cel` input provides functions, macros, and global variables to extend the language.

In addition to the extensions provided in the packages listed above, a global variable `useragent` is also provided which gives the user CEL program access to the {beatname_lc} user-agent string.

The CEL environment enables the https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/cel#OptionalTypes[optional types] library using the version defined {mito_docs}/lib#OptionalTypesVersion[here].

Additionally, it supports authentication via Basic Authentication, Digest Authentication or OAuth2.

[[input-state-cel]]
==== Input state

The `cel` input keeps a runtime state between requests. This state can be accessed by the CEL program and may contain arbitrary objects.

The state must contain a `url` string and may contain any object the user wishes to store in it.

All objects are stored at runtime, except `cursor`, which has values that are persisted between restarts.

==== Configuration options

The `cel` input supports the following configuration options plus the
<<{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-common-options>> described later.

[float]
==== `interval`

Duration between repeated requests. It may make additional pagination requests in response to the initial request if pagination is enabled. Default: `60s`.

[[program-cel]]
[float]
==== `program`

The CEL program that is executed each polling period. This field is required.

[[max_executions-cel]]
[float]
==== `max_executions`

`max_executions` is the maximum number of times a CEL program can request to be re-run with a `want_more` field. This is used to ensure that accidental infinite loops do not halt processing. When the execution budget is exceeded, execution will be restarted at the next interval and a warning will be written into the logs. Default: 1000.

[[state-cel]]
[float]
==== `state`

`state` is an optional object that is passed to the CEL program on the first execution. It is available to the executing program as the `state` variable. It is made available to subsequent executions of the program during the life of input as the returned value of the previous execution, but with the `state.events` field removed. Except for the `state.cursor` field, `state` does not persist over restarts.

[[cursor-cel]]
[float]
==== `state.cursor`

The cursor is an object available as `state.cursor` where arbitrary values may be stored. Cursor state is kept between input restarts and updated after each event of a request has been published. When a cursor is used the CEL program must either create a cursor state for each event that is returned by the program, or a single cursor that reflect the cursor for completion of the full set of events.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
# Fetch your public IP every minute and note when the last request was made.

                state.cursor.last_requested_at
            :
                now
        })],
        "cursor": {"last_requested_at": now}
    })
----

[[regexp-cel]]
[float]
==== `regexp`

A set of named regular expressions that may be used during a CEL program's execution using the `regexp` extension library. The syntax used for the regular expressions is https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2].

----
filebeat.inputs:
- type: cel
  # Define two regular expressions, 'products' and 'solutions' for use during CEL execution.
  regexp:
    products: '(?i)(Elasticsearch|Beats|Logstash|Kibana)'
    solutions: '(?i)(Search|Observability|Security)'
----

[[xsd-cel]]
[float]
==== `xsd`

XML documents may require additional type information to enable correct parsing and ingestion. This information can be provided as an XML Schema Definitions (XSD) for XML documents using the `xsd` option. The key under which the XSD information is provided is accessed via the `decode_xml` CEL extension.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
- type: cel
  # Provide an XSD, 'order', for use during CEL execution (truncated for example).
  xsd:
    order: |
       <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
         <xs:element name="order">
           <xs:complexType>
             <xs:sequence>
               <xs:element name="sender" type="xs:string"/>

This option is enabled by setting the `resource.tracer.filename` value. Additional options are available to
tune log rotation behavior.

To differentiate the trace files generated from different input instances, a placeholder `*` can be added to the filename and will be replaced with the input instance id.
For Example, `http-request-trace-*.ndjson`.

Enabling this option compromises security and should only be used for debugging.

[float]
==== `resource.tracer.maxsize`

This value sets the maximum size, in megabytes, the log file will reach before it is rotated. By default
logs are allowed to reach 1MB before rotation.

[float]
==== `resource.tracer.maxage`

This specifies the number days to retain rotated log files. If it is not set, log files are retained
indefinitely.

[float]
==== `resource.tracer.maxbackups`

The number of old logs to retain. If it is not set all old logs are retained subject to the `resource.tracer.maxage`
setting.

[float]
==== `resource.tracer.localtime`

Whether to use the host's local time rather that UTC for timestamping rotated log file names.

[float]
==== `resource.tracer.compress`

This determines whether rotated logs should be gzip compressed.

[[cel-state-redact]]
[float]
==== `redact`

During debug level logging, the `state` object and the resulting evaluation result are included in logs. This may result in leaking of secrets. In order to prevent this, fields may be redacted or deleted from the logged `state`. The `redact` configuration allows users to configure this field redaction behaviour. For safety reasons if the `redact` configuration is missing a warning is logged.

In the case of no-required redaction an empty `redact.fields` configuration should be used to silence the logged warning.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
- type: cel
  redact:
    fields: ~
----

As an example, if a user-constructed Basic Authentication request is used in a CEL program the password can be redacted like so

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
- type: cel
  resource.url: http://localhost:9200/_search
  state:
    user: user@domain.tld
    password: P@$$W0₹D
  redact:
    fields:
      - password
    delete: true
----

Note that fields under the `auth` configuration hierarchy are not exposed to the `state` and so do not need to be redacted. For this reason it is preferable to use these for authentication over the request construction shown above where possible.

[float]
==== `redact.fields`

This specifies fields in the `state` to be redacted prior to debug logging. Fields listed in this array will be either replaced with a `*` or deleted entirely from messages sent to debug logs.

[float]
==== `redact.delete`

This specifies whether fields should be replaced with a `*` or deleted entirely from messages sent to debug logs. If delete is `true`, fields will be deleted rather than replaced.

=== Metrics

This input exposes metrics under the <<http-endpoint, HTTP monitoring endpoint>>.
These metrics are exposed under the `/inputs` path. They can be used to
observe the activity of the input.

[options="header"]
|=======
| Metric                    | Description
| `resource`                | URL or path of the input resource.
| `cel_executions`          | Number times the CEL program has been executed.
| `batches_received_total`  | Number of event arrays received.
| `events_received_total`   | Number of events received.
| `batches_published_total` | Number of event arrays published.
| `events_published_total`  | Number of events published.
| `cel_processing_time`     | Histogram of the elapsed successful CEL program processing times in nanoseconds.
| `batch_processing_time`   | Histogram of the elapsed successful batch processing times in nanoseconds (time of receipt to time of ACK for non-empty batches).
|=======

==== Developer tools

A stand-alone CEL environment that implements the majority of the CEL input's Comment Expression Language functionality is available in the https://github.com/elastic/mito[Elastic Mito] repository. This tool may be used to help develop CEL programs to be used by the input. Installation is available from source by running `go install github.com/elastic/mito/cmd/mito@latest` and requires a Go toolchain.
