Beta[Input]

Use the `azure blob storage input` to read content from files stored in containers which reside on your Azure Cloud.
The input can be configured to work with and without polling, though currently, if polling is disabled it will only 
perform a one time passthrough, list the file contents and end the process. Polling is generally recommented for most cases
even though it can get expensive with dealing with a very large number of files.

*To mitigate errors and ensure a stable processing environment, this input employs the following features :* 

1.  When processing azure blob containers, if suddenly there is any outage, the process will be able to resume post the last file it processed 
    and was successfully able to save the state for. 

2.  If any errors occur for certain files, they will be logged appropriately, but the rest of the 
    files will continue to be processed normally. 

3.  If any major error occurs which stops the main thread, the logs will be appropriately generated,
    describing said error.

[id="supported-types"]
NOTE: NOTE: Currently only `JSON` and `NDJSON` are supported blob/file formats. Blobs/files may be also be gzip compressed.
As for authentication types, we currently have support for `shared access keys` and `connection strings`.

[id="basic-config"]
*A sample configuration with detailed explanation for each field is given below :-*
["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
- type: azure-blob-storage
  id: my-azureblobstorage-id
  enabled: true
  account_name: some_account
  auth.shared_credentials.account_key: some_key
  containers:
  - name: container_1
    max_workers: 3
    poll: true
    poll_interval: 10s
  - name: container_2
    max_workers: 3
    poll: true
    poll_interval: 10s
----

*Explanation :*
This `configuration` given above describes a basic blob storage config having two containers named `container_1` and `container_2`. 
Each of these containers have their own attributes such as `name`, `max_workers`, `poll` and `poll_interval`. These attributes have detailed explanations 
given <<supported-attributes,below>>. For now lets try to understand how this config works. 

For azure blob storage input to identify the files it needs to read and process, it will require the container names to be specified. We can have as
many containers as we deem fit. We are also able to configure the attributes `max_workers`, `poll` and `poll_interval` at the root level, which will
then be applied to all containers which do not specify any of these attributes explicitly. 

NOTE: If the attributes `max_workers`, `poll` and `poll_interval` are specified at the root level, these can still be overridden at the container level with 
different values, thus offering extensive flexibility and customization. Examples <<container-overrides,below>> show this behaviour.

On receiving this config the azure blob storage input will connect to the service and retrieve a `ServiceClient` using the given `account_name` and 
`auth.shared_credentials.account_key`, then it will spawn two main go-routines, one for each container. After this each of these routines (threads) will initialize a scheduler 
which will in turn use the `max_workers` value to initialize an in-memory worker pool (thread pool) with `3` `workers` available. Basically that equates to two instances of a worker pool,
one per container, each having 3 workers. These `workers` will be responsible if performing `jobs` that process a file (in this case read and output the contents of a file).

NOTE: The scheduler is responsible for scheduling jobs, and uses the `maximum available workers` in the pool, at each iteration, to decide the number of files to retrieve and 
process. This keeps work distribution efficient. The scheduler uses `poll_interval` attribute value to decide how long to wait after each iteration. Each iteration consists of 
processing a certain number of files, decided by the `maximum available workers` value.

As we can see from the response above, the `message` field contains the original stringified data. 
    
*Some of the key attributes are as follows :-* 

    1. *message* : Original stringified blob data.
    2. *log.file.path* : Path of the blob in azure cloud.
    3. *azure.storage.blob.container.name* : Name of the container from which the file has been read.
    4. *azure.storage.blob.object.name* : Name of the file/blob which has been read.
    5. *azure.storage.blob.object.content_type* : Content type of the file/blob. You can find the supported content types <<supported-types,here>>.

Now let's explore the configuration attributes a bit more elaborately.

[id="supported-attributes"]
*Supported Attributes :-*

    1. <<attrib-account-name,account_name>>
    2. <<attrib-auth-shared-account-key,auth.shared_credentials.account_key>>
    3. <<attrib-auth-connection-string,auth.connection_string.uri>>
    4. <<attrib-storage-url,storage_url>>
    5. <<attrib-containers,containers>>
    6. <<attrib-container-name,name>>
    7. <<attrib-max_workers,max_workers>>
    8. <<attrib-poll,poll>>
    9. <<attrib-poll_interval,poll_interval>>


[id="attrib-account-name"]
[float]
==== `account_name`

This attribute is required for various internal operations with respect to authentication, creating service clients and blob clients which are used internally
for various processing purposes.

[id="attrib-auth-shared-account-key"]
[float]
==== `auth.shared_credentials.account_key`

This attribute contains the *access key*, found under the `Access keys` section on Azure Clound, under the respective storage account. A single storage account
can contain multiple containers, and they will all use this common access key. 

[id="attrib-auth-connection-string"]
[float]
==== `auth.connection_string.uri`

This attribute contains the *connection string*, found under the `Access keys` section on Azure Clound, under the respective storage account. A single storage account
can contain multiple containers, and they will all use this common connection string. 

NOTE: We require only either of `auth.shared_credentials.account_key` or `auth.connection_string.uri` to be specified for authentication purposes. If both attributes are
specified, then the one that occurs first in the configuration will be used.

[id="attrib-storage-url"]
[float]
==== `storage_url`

Use this attribute to specify a custom storage URL if required. By default it points to azure cloud storage. Only use this if there is a specific need to connect to a 
different environment where blob storage is available. 

*URL format :* `{{protocol}}://{{account_name}}.{{storage_uri}}`. This attribute resides at the root level of the config and not inside any container block.

[id="attrib-containers"]
[float]
==== `containers`

This attribute contains the details about a specific container like `name`, `max_workers`, `poll` and `poll_interval`. The attribute `name` is specific to a 
container as it describes the container name, while the fields `max_workers`, `poll` and `poll_interval` can exist both at the container level and the root level.
This attribute is internally represented as an array, so we can add as many containers as we require.

[id="attrib-container-name"]
[float]
==== `name`

This is a specific subfield of a container. It specifies the container name.

[id="attrib-max_workers"]
[float]
==== `max_workers`

This attribute defines the maximum number of workers (go routines / lightweight threads) are allocated in the worker pool (thread pool) for processing jobs 
which read contents of file. More number of workers equals a greater amount of concurrency achieved. There is an upper cap of `5000` workers per container that 
can be defined due to internal sdk constraints. This attribute can be specified both at the root level of the configuration as well at the container level. 
The container level values will always take priority and override the root level values if both are specified.

[id="attrib-poll"]
[float]
==== `poll`

This attribute informs the scheduler whether to keep polling for new files or not. Default value of this is `false`, so it will not keep polling if not explicitly 
specified. This attribute can be specified both at the root level of the configuration as well at the container level. The container level values will always 
take priority and override the root level values if both are specified.

[id="attrib-poll_interval"]
[float]
==== `poll_interval`

This attribute defines the maximum amount of time after which the internal scheduler will make the polling call for the next set of blobs/files. It can be 
defined in the following formats : `{{x}}s`, `{{x}}m`, `{{x}}h`, here `s = seconds`, `m = minutes` and `h = hours`. The value `{{x}}` can be anything we wish.
Example : `10s` would mean we would like the polling to occur every 10 seconds. If no value is specified for this, by default its initialized to `300 seconds`. 
This attribute can be specified both at the root level of the configuration as well at the container level. The container level values will always 
take priority and override the root level values if both are specified.


[id="container-overrides"]
*The sample configs below will explain the container level overriding of attributes a bit further :-*

*CASE - 1 :*

Here `container_1` is using root level attributes while `container_2` overrides the values :

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
- type: azure-blob-storage
  id: my-azureblobstorage-id
  enabled: true
  account_name: some_account
  auth.shared_credentials.account_key: some_key
  max_workers: 10
  poll: true
  poll_interval: 15s
  containers:
  - name: container_1
  - name: container_2
    max_workers: 3
    poll: true
    poll_interval: 10s
----

*Explanation :*
In this configuration `container_1` has no sub attributes in `max_workers`, `poll` and `poll_interval` defined. It inherits the values for these fileds from the root 
level, which is `max_workers = 10`, `poll = true` and `poll_interval = 15 seconds`. However `container_2` has these fields defined and it will use those values instead 
of using the root values.

*CASE - 2 :*

Here both `container_1` and `container_2` overrides the root values :

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
  - type: azure-blob-storage
    id: my-azureblobstorage-id
    enabled: true
    account_name: some_account
    auth.shared_credentials.account_key: some_key
    max_workers: 10
    poll: true
    poll_interval: 15s
    containers:
    - name: container_1
      max_workers: 5
      poll: true
      poll_interval: 10s
    - name: container_2
      max_workers: 5
      poll: true
      poll_interval: 10s
----

*Explanation :*
In this configuration even though we have specified `max_workers = 10`, `poll = true` and `poll_interval = 15s` at the root level, both the containers
will override these values with their own respective values which are defined as part of their sub attibutes.


NOTE: Since this is a beta input, any feedback is welcome, which will help us optimise and make it better going forward.
