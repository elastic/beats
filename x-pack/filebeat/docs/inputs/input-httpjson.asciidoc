=== HTTP JSON input

++++
<titleabbrev>HTTP JSON</titleabbrev>
++++

Use the `httpjson` input to read messages from an HTTP API with JSON payloads.

If you are starting development of a new custom HTTP API input, we recommend that you use the <<filebeat-input-cel,Common Expression Language input>> which provides greater flexibility and an improved developer experience.

This input supports:

* Auth
** Basic
** OAuth2
* Retrieval at a configurable interval
* Pagination
* Retries
* Rate limiting
* Proxying
* Request transformations
* Response transformations

Example configurations:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
# Fetch your public IP every minute.
- type: httpjson
  interval: 1m
  request.url: https://api.ipify.org/?format=json
  processors:
    - decode_json_fields:
        fields: ["message"]
        target: "json"
----

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
- type: httpjson
  request.url: http://localhost:9200/_search?scroll=5m
  request.method: POST
  response.split:
    target: body.hits.hits
  response.pagination:
    - set:
        target: url.value
        value: http://localhost:9200/_search/scroll
    - set:

        value: '[[.last_response.body._scroll_id]]'
    - set:
        target: body.scroll
        value: 5m

[[input-state]]
==== Input state

The `httpjson` input keeps a runtime state between requests. This state can be accessed by some configuration options and transforms.

The state has the following elements:

- `last_response.url.value`: The full URL with params and fragments from the last request with a successful response.
- `last_response.url.params`: A https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#Values[`url.Values`] of the params from the URL in `last_response.url.value`.  Can be queried with the https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#Values.Get[`Get`] function.
- `last_response.header`: A map containing the headers from the last successful response.
- `last_response.body`: A map containing the parsed JSON body from the last successful response. This is the response as it comes from the remote server.
- `last_response.page`: A number indicating the page number of the last response. It starts with the value `0` at every interval.
- `first_event`: A map representing the first event sent to the output (result from applying transforms to `last_response.body`).
- `last_event`: A map representing the last event of the current request in the requests chain (result from applying transforms to `last_response.body`).
- `url`: The last requested URL as a raw https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#URL[`url.URL`] Go type.
- `header`: A map containing the headers. References the next request headers when used in <<request-transforms-headers>> or <<response-pagination>> configuration sections, and to the last response headers when used in <<response-transforms>>, <<response-split>>, or <<request-rate-limit>> configuration sections.
- `body`: A map containing the body. References the next request body when used in <<request-transforms-headers>> or <<response-pagination>> configuration sections, and to the last response body when used in <<response-transforms>> or <<response-split>> configuration sections.
- `cursor`: A map containing any data the user configured to be stored between restarts (See <<cursor>>).

All of the mentioned objects are only stored at runtime, except `cursor`, which has values that are persisted between restarts.

[[transforms]]
==== Transforms

A transform is an action that lets the user modify the <<input-state,input state>>. Depending on where the transform is defined, it will have access for reading or writing different elements of the <<input-state,state>>.

The access limitations are described in the corresponding configuration sections.

[float]
==== `append`

Appends a value to an array. If the field does not exist, the first entry will create a new array. If the field exists, the value is appended to the existing field and converted to a list.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
- append:
    target: body.foo.bar
    value: '[[.cursor.baz]]'
    default: "a default value"
----

- `target` defines the destination field where the value is stored.
- `value` defines the value that will be stored and it is a <<value-templates,value template>>.
- `default` defines the fallback value whenever `value` is empty or the template parsing fails. Default templates do not have access to any state, only to functions.
- `value_type` defines the type of the resulting value. Possible values are: `string`, `json`, and `int`. Default is `string`.
- `fail_on_template_error` if set to `true` an error will be returned and the request will be aborted when the template evaluation fails. Default is `false`.

[float]
==== `delete`

Deletes the target field.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
- delete:
    target: body.foo.bar
----

- `target` defines the destination field to delete. If `target` is a list and not a single element, the complete list will be deleted.

[float]
==== `set`

Sets a value.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
- set:
    target: body.foo.bar
    value: '[[.cursor.baz]]'
    default: "a default value"
----

- `target` defines the destination field where the value is stored.
- `value` defines the value that will be stored and it is a <<value-templates,value template>>.
- `default` defines the fallback value whenever `value` is empty or the template parsing fails. Default templates do not have access to any state, only to functions.
- `value_type` defines how the resulting value will be treated. Possible values are: `string`, `json`, and `int`. Default is `string`.
- `fail_on_template_error` if set to `true` an error will be returned and the request will be aborted when the template evaluation fails. Default is `false`.

[[value-templates]]
==== Value templates

Some configuration options and transforms can use value templates. Value templates are Go templates with access to the input state and to some built-in functions.
Please note that delimiters are changed from the default `{{ }}` to `[[ ]]` to improve interoperability with other templating mechanisms.

To see which <<input-state,state elements>> and operations are available, see the documentation for the option or <<transforms,transform>> where you want to use a value template.

A value template looks like:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
- set:
    target: body.foo.bar
    value: '[[.cursor.baz]] more data'
    default: "a default value"
----

The content inside the brackets `[[` `]]` is evaluated. For more information on Go templates please refer to https://golang.org/pkg/text/template[the Go docs].

Some built-in helper functions are provided to work with the input state inside value templates:

- `add`: adds a list of integers and returns their sum.
- `base64DecodeNoPad`: Decodes the base64 string without padding. Any binary output will be converted to a UTF8 string.
- `base64Decode`: Decodes the base64 string. Any binary output will be converted to a UTF8 string.
- `base64EncodeNoPad`: Joins and base64 encodes all supplied strings without padding. Example `[[base64EncodeNoPad "string1" "string2"]]`
- `base64Encode`: Joins and base64 encodes all supplied strings. Example `[[base64Encode "string1" "string2"]]`
- `beatInfo`: returns a map containing information about the Beat.  Available keys in the map are `goos` (running operating system), `goarch` (running system architecture), `commit` (git commit of current build), `buildtime` (compile time of current build), `version` (version of current build). Example: `[[ beatInfo.version ]]` returns `{version}`.
- `div`: does the integer division of two integer values.
- `formatDate`: formats a `time.Time`. By default the format layout is `RFC3339` but optionally can accept any of the Golang predefined layouts or a custom one. It will default to UTC timezone when formatting, but you can specify a different timezone. If the timezone is incorrect, it will default to UTC. Example: `[[ formatDate (now) "UnixDate" ]]`, `[[ formatDate (now) "UnixDate" "America/New_York" ]]`.
- `getRFC5988Link`: extracts a specific relation from a list of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988[RFC5988] links. It is useful when parsing header values for pagination. Example: `[[ getRFC5988Link "next" .last_response.header.Link ]]`.
- `hashBase64`: calculates the hash of a list of strings concatenated together. Returns a base64 encoded hash. Supports sha1 or sha256. Example `[[hash "sha256" "string1" "string2" (formatDate (now) "RFC1123")]]`
- `hash`: calculates the hash of a list of strings concatenated together. Returns a hex encoded hash. Supports sha1 or sha256. Example `[[hash "sha256" "string1" "string2" (formatDate (now) "RFC1123")]]`
- `hexDecode`: Decodes the hexadecimal string. Any hexadecimal string will be converted to its bytes representation. Example `[[hexDecode "b0a92a08a9b4883aa3aa2d0957be12a678cbdbb32dc5db09fe68239a09872f96"]]`; Expected Output: `"\xb0\xa9*\b\xa9\xb4\x88:\xa3\xaa-\tW\xbe\x12\xa6x\xcb۳-\xc5\xdb\t\xfeh#\x9a\t\x87/\x96"`
- `hmacBase64`: calculates the hmac signature of a list of strings concatenated together. Returns a base64 encoded signature. Supports sha1 or sha256. Example `[[hmac "sha256" "secret" "string1" "string2" (formatDate (now) "RFC1123")]]`
- `hmac`: calculates the hmac signature of a list of strings concatenated together. Returns a hex encoded signature. Supports sha1 or sha256. Example `[[hmac "sha256" "secret" "string1" "string2" (formatDate (now) "RFC1123")]]`
- `join`: joins a list using the specified separator. Example: `[[join .body.arr ","]]`
- `max`: returns the maximum of two values.
- `min`: returns the minimum of two values.
- `mul`: multiplies two integers.
- `now`: returns the current `time.Time` object in UTC. Optionally, it can receive a `time.Duration` as a parameter. Example: `[[now (parseDuration "-1h")]]` returns the time at 1 hour before now.
- `parseDate`: parses a date string and returns a `time.Time` in UTC. By default the expected layout is `RFC3339` but optionally can accept any of the Golang predefined layouts or a custom one. Example: `[[ parseDate "2020-11-05T12:25:32Z" ]]`, `[[ parseDate "2020-11-05T12:25:32.1234567Z" "RFC3339Nano" ]]`, `[[ (parseDate "Thu Nov  5 12:25:32 +0000 2020" "Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 -0700 2006").UTC ]]`.
- `parseDuration`: parses duration strings and returns `time.Duration`. Example: `[[parseDuration "1h"]]`.
- `parseTimestampMilli`: parses a timestamp in milliseconds and returns a `time.Time` in UTC. Example: `[[parseTimestamp 1604582732000]]` returns `2020-11-05 13:25:32 +0000 UTC`.
- `parseTimestampNano`: parses a timestamp in nanoseconds and returns a `time.Time` in UTC. Example: `[[parseTimestamp 1604582732000000000]]` returns `2020-11-05 13:25:32 +0000 UTC`.
- `parseTimestamp`: parses a timestamp in seconds and returns a `time.Time` in UTC. Example: `[[parseTimestamp 1604582732]]` returns `2020-11-05 13:25:32 +0000 UTC`.
- `replaceAll(old, new, s)`: replaces all non-overlapping instances of `old` with `new` in `s`. Example: `[[ replaceAll "some" "my" "some value" ]]` returns `my value`.
- `sprintf`: formats according to a format specifier and returns the resulting string. Refer to https://pkg.go.dev/fmt#Sprintf[the Go docs] for usage. Example: `[[sprintf "%d:%q" 34 "quote this"]]`
- `toInt`: converts a value of any type to an integer when possible. Returns 0 if the conversion fails.
- `toJSON`: converts a value to a JSON string. This can be used with `value_type: json` to create an object from a template. Example: `[[ toJSON .last_response.body.pagingIdentifiers ]]`.
- `urlEncode`: URL encodes the supplied string. Example `[[urlEncode "string1"]]`. Example `[[urlEncode "<string1>"]]` will return `%3Cstring1%3E`.
- `userAgent`: generates the User Agent with optional additional values. If no arguments are provided, it will generate the default User Agent that is added to all requests by default. It is recommended to delete the existing User-Agent header before setting a new one. Example: `[[ userAgent "integration/1.2.3" ]]` would generate `Elastic-Filebeat/8.1.0 (darwin; amd64; 9b893e88cfe109e64638d65c58fd75c2ff695402; 2021-12-15 13:20:00 +0000 UTC; integration_name/1.2.3)`
- `uuid`: returns a random UUID such as `a11e8780-e3e7-46d0-8e76-f66e75acf019`. Example: `[[ uuid ]]`

In addition to the provided functions, any of the native functions for https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time[`time.Time`], https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Header[`http.Header`], and https://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#Values[`url.Values`] types can be used on the corresponding objects. Examples: `[[(now).Day]]`, `[[.last_response.header.Get "key"]]`

[float]
==== `request.ssl`

This specifies SSL/TLS configuration. If the ssl section is missing, the host's
CAs are used for HTTPS connections. See <<configuration-ssl>> for more
information.

[float]
==== `request.proxy_url`

This specifies proxy configuration in the form of `http[s]://<user>:<password>@<server name/ip>:<port>`

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
# Fetch your public IP every minute.
- type: httpjson
  interval: 1m
  request.url: https://api.ipify.org/?format=json
  request.proxy_url: http://proxy.example:8080
----

[float]
==== `request.keep_alive.disable`

This specifies whether to disable keep-alives for HTTP end-points. Default: `true`.

[float]
==== `request.keep_alive.max_idle_connections`

The maximum number of idle connections across all hosts. Zero means no limit. Default: `0`.

[float]
==== `request.keep_alive.max_idle_connections_per_host`

The maximum idle connections to keep per-host. If zero, defaults to two. Default: `0`.

[float]
==== `request.keep_alive.idle_connection_timeout`

The maximum amount of time an idle connection will remain idle before closing itself. Valid time units are `ns`, `us`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. Zero means no limit. Default: `0s`.

[float]
==== `request.retry.max_attempts`

The maximum number of retries for the HTTP client. Default: `5`.

[float]
==== `request.retry.wait_min`

The minimum time to wait before a retry is attempted. Default: `1s`.

[float]
==== `request.retry.wait_max`

The maximum time to wait before a retry is attempted. Default: `60s`.

[float]
==== `request.redirect.forward_headers`

When set to `true` request headers are forwarded in case of a redirect. Default: `false`.

[float]
==== `request.redirect.headers_ban_list`

When `redirect.forward_headers` is set to `true`, all headers __except__ the ones defined in this list will be forwarded. Default: `[]`.

[float]
==== `request.redirect.max_redirects`

The maximum number of redirects to follow for a request. Default: `10`.

[[request-rate-limit]]
[float]
==== `request.rate_limit.limit`

The value of the response that specifies the total limit. It is defined with a Go template value.
Can read state from: [`.last_response.header`]

[float]
==== `request.rate_limit.remaining`

The value of the response that specifies the remaining quota of the rate limit.
It is defined with a Go template value. Can read state from: [`.last_response.header`]
If the `remaining` header is missing from the Response, no rate-limiting will occur.

[float]
==== `request.rate_limit.reset`

The value of the response that specifies the epoch time when the rate limit will reset.
It is defined with a Go template value. Can read state from: [`.last_response.header`]

[[request-transforms-headers]]
[float]
==== `request.rate_limit.early_limit`

Optionally start rate-limiting prior to the value specified in the Response.

Under the default behavior, Requests will continue while the `remaining` value is non-zero.
Specifying an `early_limit` will mean that rate-limiting will occur prior to reaching `0`.

* If the value specified for `early_limit` is less than `1`,
the value is treated as a percentage of the Response provided `limit`.
e.g. specifying `0.9` will mean that Requests will continue until reaching 90% of the rate-limit --
for a `limit` value of `120`, the rate-limit starts when the `remaining` reaches `12`.
If the `limit` header is missing from the Response, default rate-limiting will occur (when `remaining` reaches `0`).
* If the value specified for `early_limit` is greater than or equal to `1`,
the value is treated as the target value for `remaining`.
e.g. instead of rate-limiting when `remaining` hits `0`, rate-limiting will occur when `remaining` hits the value specified.

It is not set by default (by default the rate-limiting as specified in the Response is followed).

[[request-transforms]]
[float]
==== `request.transforms`

List of transforms to apply to the request before each execution.

Available transforms for request: [`append`, `delete`, `set`].

Can read state from: [`.first_response.*`,`.last_response.*`, `.parent_last_response.*` `.last_event.*`, `.cursor.*`, `.header.*`, `.url.*`, `.body.*`].

Can write state to: [`body.*`, `header.*`, `url.*`].

        value: '[[now (parseDuration "-1h")]]'
----

NOTE: The clause `.parent_last_response.` should only be used from within chain steps and when pagination exists at the root request level. If pagination
does not exist at the root level, please use the clause `.first_response.` to access parent response object from within chains. You can look at this
**example** below for a better idea.

      - set:
          target: body.page
          value: '[[ .last_response.body.page ]]'
          fail_on_template_error: true
    chain:
    - step:
          request.url: http://xyz.com/services/data/v1.0/$.exportId/export_ids/$.files[:].id/info
          request.method: POST
          request.transforms:
          - set:
              target: body.exportId
              value: '[[ .parent_last_response.body.exportId ]]'
          replace: $.files[:].id
          replace_with: '$.exportId,.parent_last_response.body.exportId'

Here we can see that the chain step uses `.parent_last_response.body.exportId` only because `response.pagination` is present for the parent (root) request.
However if `response.pagination` was not present in the parent (root) request, `replace_with` clause should have used `.first_response.body.exportId`. This is
because when pagination does not exist at the parent level `parent_last_response` object is not populated with required values for performance reasons, but the `first_response` object always stores the very first response in the process chain.

NOTE: The `first_response` object at the moment can only store flat JSON structures (i.e. no support for JSONS having array at root level, NDJSON or Gzipped JSON), hence it should only be used in scenarios where the this is the case. Splits cannot be performed on `first_response`. It needs to be explicitly enabled by setting the flag `response.save_first_response` to `true` in the httpjson config.

[float]
==== `request.tracer.filename`

It is possible to log httpjson requests and responses to a local file-system for debugging configurations.
This option is enabled by setting the `request.tracer.filename` value. Additional options are available to
tune log rotation behavior.

To differentiate the trace files generated from different input instances, a placeholder `*` can be added to the filename and will be replaced with the input instance id.
For Example, `http-request-trace-*.ndjson`.

Enabling this option compromises security and should only be used for debugging.

[float]
==== `request.tracer.maxsize`

This value sets the maximum size, in megabytes, the log file will reach before it is rotated. By default
logs are allowed to reach 1MB before rotation.

[float]
==== `request.tracer.maxage`

This specifies the number days to retain rotated log files. If it is not set, log files are retained
indefinitely.

[float]
==== `request.tracer.maxbackups`

The number of old logs to retain. If it is not set all old logs are retained subject to the `request.tracer.maxage`
setting.

[float]
==== `request.tracer.localtime`

Whether to use the host's local time rather that UTC for timestamping rotated log file names.

[float]
==== `request.tracer.compress`

This determines whether rotated logs should be gzip compressed.

[float]
==== `response.decode_as`

ContentType used for decoding the response body. If set it will force the decoding in the specified format regardless of the `Content-Type` header value, otherwise it will honor it if possible or fallback to `application/json`. Supported values: `application/json, application/x-ndjson`, `text/csv`, `application/zip`, `application/xml` and `text/xml`. It is not set by default.

NOTE: For `text/csv`, one event for each line will be created, using the header values as the object keys. For this reason is always assumed that a header exists.

NOTE: For `application/zip`, the `zip` file is expected to contain one or more `.json` or `.ndjson` files. The contents of all of them will be merged into a single list of `JSON` objects.

NOTE: For `application/xml` and `text/xml` type information for decoding the XML document can be provided via the `response.xsd` option.

[float]
==== `response.xsd`

XML documents may require additional type information to enable correct parsing and ingestion. This information can be provided as an XML Schema Definition (XSD) for the document using the `response.xsd` option.

[[response-transforms]]
[float]
==== `response.transforms`

List of transforms to apply to the response once it is received.

Available transforms for response: [`append`, `delete`, `set`].

Can read state from: [`.last_response.*`, `.last_event.*`, `.cursor.*`, `.header.*`, `.url.*`].

Can write state to: [`body.*`].

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
filebeat.inputs:
- type: httpjson
  request.url: http://localhost:9200/_search?scroll=5m
  request.method: POST
  response.transforms:
    - delete:
        target: body.very_confidential
  response.split:
    target: body.hits.hits
  response.pagination:
    - set:
        target: url.value
        value: http://localhost:9200/_search/scroll
    - set:
        target: url.params.scroll_id
        value: '[[.last_response.body._scroll_id]]'
    - set:
        target: body.scroll
        value: 5m
----

[[response-split]]
[float]
==== `response.split`

Split operation to apply to the response once it is received. A split can convert a map, array, or string into multiple events.
If the split target is empty the parent document will be kept. If documents with empty splits should be dropped, the `ignore_empty_value` option should be set to `true`.

[float]
==== `response.split[].target`

Defines the target field upon the split operation will be performed.

[float]
==== `response.split[].type`

Defines the field type of the target. Allowed values: `array`, `map`, `string`. `string` requires the use of the `delimiter` options to specify what characters to split the string on.  `delimiter` always behaves as if `keep_parent` is set to `true`. Default: `array`.

[float]
==== `response.split[].transforms`

A set of transforms can be defined. This list will be applied after <<response-transforms, response.transforms>> and after the object has been modified based on `response.split[].keep_parent` and `response.split[].key_field`.

Available transforms for response: [`append`, `delete`, `set`].

Can read state from: [`.last_response.*`, `.first_event.*`, `.last_event.*`, `.cursor.*`, `.header.*`, `.url.*`].

Can write state to: [`body.*`].

NOTE: in this context, `body.*` will be the result of all the previous transformations.

[float]
==== `response.split[].keep_parent`

If set to true, the fields from the parent document (at the same level as `target`) will be kept. Otherwise a new document will be created using `target` as the root. Default: `false`.

[float]
==== `response.split[].delimiter`

Required if using split type of `string`.  This is the sub string used to split the string.  For example if `delimiter` was "\n" and the string was "line 1\nline 2", then the split would result in "line 1" and "line 2".

[float]
==== `response.split[].key_field`

Valid when used with `type: map`. When not empty, defines a new field where the original key value will be stored.

[float]
==== `response.split[].ignore_empty_value`

If set to true, empty or missing value will be ignored and processing will pass on to the next nested split operation instead of failing with an error. Default: `false`.

[float]
==== `response.split[].split`

Nested split operation. Split operations can be nested at will. An event won't be created until the deepest split operation is applied.

[float]
==== `response.request_body_on_pagination`

If set to true, the values in `request.body` are sent for pagination requests. Default: `false`.

[[response-pagination]]
[float]
==== `response.pagination`

List of transforms that will be applied to the response to every new page request. All the transforms from `request.transform` will be executed and then `response.pagination` will be added to modify the next request as needed. For subsequent responses, the usual <<response-transforms, response.transforms>> and <<response-split, response.split>> will be executed normally.

Available transforms for pagination: [`append`, `delete`, `set`].

Can read state from: [`.last_response.*`, `.first_event.*`, `.last_event.*`, `.cursor.*`, `.header.*`, `.url.*`, `.body.*`].

Can write state to: [`body.*`, `header.*`, `url.*`].

Examples using split:

- We have a response with two nested arrays, and we want a document for each of the elements of the inner array:

[[chain]]
[float]
=== `chain`

A chain is a list of requests to be made after the first one.

[float]
==== `chain[].step`

Contains basic request and response configuration for chained calls.

[float]
==== `chain[].step.request`

See <<request-parameters,request parameters>>. Required.

Example:

First call: \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/

Second call: \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/1/export_ids

Third call: \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/export_ids/file_1/info

[float]

[[chain-step-replace]]
[float]
==== `chain[].step.replace`

A link:https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e2[JSONPath] string to parse values from responses JSON, collected from previous chain steps. Place same replace string in url where collected values from previous call should be placed. Required.

Example:

- First call: \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/

request_url using file_name as 'file_2': \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/export_ids/file_2/info

+
Collect and make events from response in any format supported by httpjson for all calls.

+
Note that since `request.url` must be a valid URL, if an API returns complete URLs in place of an identifier as in the example above, it would not be possible to use the JSON Path syntax. To achieve the desired result in this case an opaque URI syntax can be used. An opaque URI has an arbitrary scheme and opaque text separated by a colon. When the replacement is done, the scheme and colon are stripped from the URI prior to the replacement and the remaining opaque text is used as the replacement target. In the following example, the scheme is "placeholder".

[[chain-step-replace_with]]
[float]
==== `chain[].step.replace_with`

The `replace_with: "pattern,value"` clause is used to replace a fixed pattern string defined in `request.url` with the given value.
The fixed pattern must have a `$.` prefix, for example: `$.xyz`. The `value` may be hard coded or extracted from context variables
like [`.last_response.*`, `.first_response.*`, `.parent_last_response.*`] etc. The `replace_with` clause can be used in combination with the `replace` clause
thus providing a lot of flexibility in the logic of chain requests.

Example:

- First call: \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/exports
+
<<response-json1-replace_with,response>>

- Second call: \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/$.exportId/files

        },
        {
            "id": 3,
        },
    ]
}
----
This behaviour of targeted fixed pattern replacement in the url helps solve various use cases.

**Some useful points to remember:- **

    1. If you want the `value` to be treated as an expression to be evaluated for data extraction from context variables, it should always have a
    **single '.' (dot) prefix**. Example: `replace_with: '$.exportId,.first_response.body.exportId'`. Anything more or less will have the internal
    processor treat it as a hard coded value, `replace_with: '$.exportId,..first_response.body.exportId'` (more than one '.' (dot) as prefix) or
    `replace_with:'$.exportId,first_response.body.exportId'` (no '.' dot as prefix)

   2. Incomplete `value expressions` will cause an error while processing. Example: `replace_with: '$.exportId,.first_response.'`, `replace_with:
    '$.exportId,.last_response.'` etc. These expressions are incomplete because they do not evaluate down to a valid key that can be extracted from
    the context variables. The value expression: `.first_response.`, on processing, will result in an array `[first_response ""]` where the key to be
    extrated becomes `"" (an empty string)`, which has no definition within any context variable.

NOTE: Fixed patterns must not contain commas in their definition. String replacement patterns are matched by the `replace_with` processor with exact string matching. The `first_response` object at the moment can only store flat JSON structures (i.e. no support for JSONS having array at root level, NDJSON or Gzipped JSON), hence it should only be used in scenarios where the this is the case. Splits cannot be performed on `first_response`. It needs to be explicitly enabled by setting the flag `response.save_first_response` to `true` in the httpjson config.

[float]
==== `chain[].while`

Contains basic request and response configuration for chained while calls. Chained while calls will keep making the requests for a given number of times until a condition is met
or the maximum number of attempts gets exhausted. While chain has an attribute `until` which holds the expression to be evaluated. Ideally the `until` field should always be used
together with the attributes `request.retry.max_attempts` and `request.retry.wait_min` which specifies the maximum number of attempts to evaluate `until` before giving up and the
maximum wait time in between such requests. If `request.retry.max_attempts` is not specified, it will only try to evaluate the expression once and give up if it fails. If
`request.retry.wait_min` is not specified the default wait time will always be `0` as in successive calls will be made immediately.

[float]
==== `chain[].while.request`

See  <<request-parameters,request parameters>> .

Example:

First call: \http://example.com/services/data/v1.0/exports

Second call: \http://example.com/services/data/v1.0/9ef0e6a5/export_ids/status

Third call: \http://example.com/services/data/v1.0/export_ids/1/info

Example:

- First call to collect export ids

+
response_json:

+
[[response-json1-while]]
["source","json",subs="attributes"]
----
{
    "exportId": "9ef0e6a5"
}
----

- Second call to collect `file_ids` using collected id from first call when `response.body.sataus == "completed"`. This call continues until the condition is satisfied or the maximum number of attempts gets exhausted.

+
request_url using id as '9ef0e6a5': \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/9ef0e6a5/export_ids/status

+
response_json using id as '9ef0e6a5':

+
[[response-json2-while]]
["source","json",subs="attributes"]
----
{
    "status": "completed",
    "files": [
      {
        "id": 1
      },
      {
        "id": 2
      },
      {
        "id": 3
      }
    ]
}
----

- Third call to collect `files` using collected `file_id` from second call.

+
request_url using file_id as '1': \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/export_ids/1/info

+
request_url using file_id as '2': \https://example.com/services/data/v1.0/export_ids/2/info

+
response_json using id as '1':

+
[[response-json3-while]]
["source","json",subs="attributes"]
----
{
    "file_name": "file_1",
    "file_data": "some data"
}
----

+
response_json using id as '2':

+
[[response-json4-while]]
["source","json",subs="attributes"]
----
{
    "file_name": "file_2",
    "file_data": "some data"
}
----

+
Collect and make events from response in any format supported by httpjson for all calls.

+
Note that since `request.url` must be a valid URL, if an API returns complete URLs in place of an identifier as in the example above, it would not be possible to use the JSON Path syntax. To achieve the desired result in this case an opaque URI syntax can be used. An opaque URI has an arbitrary scheme and opaque text separated by a colon. When the replacement is done, the scheme and colon are stripped from the URI prior to the replacement and the remaining opaque text is used as the replacement target. In the following example, the scheme is "placeholder".

- type: httpjson
  enabled: true
  # first call
  id: my-httpjson-id
  request.url: http://example.com/services/data/v1.0/exports

    # second call
    - while:
        request.url: placeholder:$.exportId
        request.method: GET
        replace: $.exportId
        until: '[[ eq .last_response.body.status "completed" ]]'
        request.retry.max_attempts: 5
        request.retry.wait_min: 5s
    # third call
    - step:
        request.url: placeholder:$.files[:]
        request.method: GET
        replace: $.files[:]

NOTE: httpjson chain will only create and ingest events from last call on chained configurations. Also, the current chain only supports the following: all <<request-parameters, request parameters>>, <<response-transforms, response.transforms>> and <<response-split, response.split>>.

See  <<chain-step-replace_with, chain[].step.replace_with>> .

[[cursor]]
[float]
==== `cursor`

Cursor is a list of key value objects where arbitrary values are defined. The values are interpreted as  <<value-templates,value templates>> and a default template can be set. Cursor state is kept between input restarts and updated once all the events for a request are published.

Each cursor entry is formed by:

- A `value` template, which will define the value to store when evaluated.
- A `default` template, which will define the value to store when the value template fails or is empty.
- An `ignore_empty_value` flag. When set to `true`, will not store empty values, preserving the previous one, if any. Default: `true`.

Can read state from: [`.last_response.*`, `.first_event.*`, `.last_event.*`].

NOTE: Default templates do not have access to any state, only to functions.

==== Request life cycle

image:images/input-httpjson-lifecycle.png[Request lifecycle]

. At every defined interval a new request is created.
. The request is transformed using the configured <<request-transforms, request.transforms>>.
. The resulting transformed request is executed.
. The server responds (here is where any retry or rate limit policy takes place when configured).
. The response is transformed using the configured <<response-transforms, response.transforms>> and <<response-split, response.split>>.
. If a chain step is configured. Each step will generate new requests based on collected IDs from responses. The requests will be transformed using configured <<request-transforms, request.transforms>> and the resulting generated transformed requests will be executed. This process will happen for all the steps mentioned in the chain.
. Each resulting event is published to the output.
. If a `response.pagination` is configured and there are more pages, a new request is created using it, otherwise the process ends until the next interval.

image:images/input-httpjson-chain-lifecycle.png[Chain Request lifecycle]

. Response from regular call will be processed.
. Extract data from response and generate new requests from responses.
. Process generated requests and collect responses from server.
. Go back to step-2 for the next step.
. Publish collected responses from the last chain step.
