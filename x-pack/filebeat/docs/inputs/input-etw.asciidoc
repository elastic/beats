https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/event-tracing-portal[Event
Tracing for Windows] is a powerful logging and tracing mechanism built into the
Windows operating system. It provides a detailed view of application and system
behavior, performance issues, and runtime diagnostics. Trace events contain an
event header and provider-defined data that describes the current state of an
application or operation. You can use the events to debug an application and
perform capacity and performance analysis.

The ETW input can interact with ETW in three distinct ways: it can create a new
session to capture events from user-mode providers, attach to an already
existing session to collect ongoing event data, or read events from a
pre-recorded .etl file. This functionality enables the module to adapt to
different scenarios, such as real-time event monitoring or analyzing historical
data.

This input currently supports manifest-based, MOF (classic) and TraceLogging
providers while WPP providers are not supported.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing#types-of-providers[Here]
you can find more information about the available types of providers.

It has been tested in the Windows versions supported by {beatname_uc}, starting
from Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. In addition, administrative privileges
are required to control event tracing sessions.

Example configurations:

Read from a provider by name:
["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: etw
  id: etw-dnsserver
  enabled: true
  provider.name: Microsoft-Windows-DNSServer
  session_name: DNSServer-Analytical
  trace_level: verbose
  match_any_keyword: "0x8000000000000000"
  match_all_keyword: "0x0000000000000000"
----

Read from a provider by its GUID:
["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: etw
  id: etw-dnsserver
  enabled: true
  provider.guid: {EB79061A-A566-4698-9119-3ED2807060E7}
  session_name: DNSServer-Analytical
  trace_level: verbose
  match_any_keyword: "0x8000000000000000"
  match_all_keyword: "0x0000000000000000"
----

Read from an existing session:
["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: etw
  enabled: true
  id: etw-dnsserver-session
  session: UAL_Usermode_Provider
----

Read from a .etl file:
["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: etw
  enabled: true
  id: etw-dnsserver-session
  file: "C\Windows\System32\Winevt\Logs\Logfile.etl"
----

NOTE: Examples shown above are mutually exclusive, the options
`provider.name`, `provider.guid`, `session` and `file` cannot be present at the
same time. Nevertheless, it is a requirement that one of them is present.

Multiple providers example:
["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: etw
  id: etw-dnsserver
  enabled: true
  provider.name: Microsoft-Windows-DNSServer
  session_name: DNSServer-Analytical
  trace_level: verbose
  match_any_keyword: "0xffffffffffffffff"
  match_all_keyword: "0x0000000000000000"
- type: etw
  id: etw-security
  enabled: true
  provider.name: Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing
  session_name: Security-Auditing
  trace_level: warning
  match_any_keyword: "0xffffffffffffffff"
  match_all_keyword: "0x0000000000000000"

==== Configuration options

The `etw` input supports the following configuration options plus the
<<{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-common-options>> described later.

[float]
==== `file`

Specifies the path to an .etl file for reading ETW events. This file format is
commonly used for storing ETW event logs.

[float]
==== `provider.guid`

Identifies the GUID of an ETW provider. To see available providers, use the
command `logman query providers`.

[float]
==== `provider.name`

Specifies the name of the ETW provider. Available providers can be listed using
`logman query providers`.

[float]
==== `session_name`

When specifying a provider, a new session is created. This controls the name for
the new ETW session it will create. If not specified, the session will be named
using the provider ID prefixed by 'Elastic-'.

[float]
==== `trace_level`

Defines the filtering level for events based on severity. Valid options include
critical, error, warning, information, and verbose.

[float]
==== `match_any_keyword`

An 8-byte bitmask used for filtering events from specific provider subcomponents
based on keyword matching. Any matching keyword will enable the event to be
written. Default value is `0xffffffffffffffff` so it matches every available
keyword.

The correct format for these fields is `0x` followed by a 16-character hexadecimal number.

Run `logman query providers "<provider.name>"` to list the available keywords
for a specific provider.

[float]
==== `match_all_keyword`

Similar to MatchAnyKeyword, this 8-byte bitmask filters events that match all
specified keyword bits. Default value is `0x0000000000000000` to let every event pass.

The correct format for these fields is `0x` followed by a 16-character hexadecimal number.

Run `logman query providers "<provider.name>"` to list the available keywords
for a specific provider.

[float]
==== `session`

Names an existing ETW session to read from. Existing sessions can be listed
using `logman query -ets`.

=== Metrics

This input exposes metrics under the <<http-endpoint, HTTP monitoring endpoint>>.
These metrics are exposed under the `/inputs/` path. They can be used to
observe the activity of the input.

You must assign a unique `id` to the input to expose metrics.

[options="header"]
|=======
| Metric                   | Description
| `session`                | Name of the ETW session.
| `received_events_total`  | Total number of events received.
| `discarded_events_total` | Total number of discarded events.
| `errors_total`           | Total number of errors.
| `source_lag_time`        | Histogram of the difference between timestamped event's creation and reading.
| `arrival_period`         | Histogram of the elapsed time between event notification callbacks.
| `processing_time`        | Histogram of the elapsed time between event notification callback and publication to the internal queue.
|=======

Histogram metrics are aggregated over the previous 1024 events.
