  # Backoff values define how aggressively filebeat crawls new files for updates
  # The default values can be used in most cases. Backoff defines how long it is waited
  # to check a file again after EOF is reached. Default is 1s which means the file

  # Max backoff defines what the maximum backoff time is. After having backed off multiple times
  # from checking the files, the waiting time will never exceed max_backoff independent of the

  # file after having backed off multiple times, it takes a maximum of 10s to read the new line
  #max_backoff: 10s

  # The backoff factor defines how fast the algorithm backs off. The bigger the backoff factor,

#================================ Processors ===================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#- include_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu"]
#- drop_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#- drop_event:
#    when:
#       equals:
#           http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#- rename:
#    fields:
#       - from: "a"
#         to: "b"
#
# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#
#processors:
#- dissect:
#    tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#    field: "message"
#    target_prefix: "dissect"
#
# The following example enriches each event with metadata from the cloud
# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#- add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#- add_locale:
#    format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:

#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.

#processors:
#- add_process_metadata:

#    target: system.process.parent
