        The client's version string.

    - name: direction
      type: keyword
      description: |
        Direction of the connection. If the client was a local host logging into
        an external host, this would be OUTBOUND. INBOUND would be set for the
        opposite situation.

    - name: host_key
      type: keyword

        The server's key thumbprint.

    - name: server
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The server's version string.

    - name: version
      type: integer
      description: >
        SSH major version (1 or 2).

    - name: algorithm
      type: group

      fields:
        - name: cipher
          type: keyword

            The encryption algorithm in use.

        - name: compression

      type: group
      fields:
        - name: attempts
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of authentication attemps we observed. There's always at
            least one, since some servers might support no authentication at all.
            It's important to note that not all of these are failures, since some
            servers require two-factor auth (e.g. password AND pubkey).
