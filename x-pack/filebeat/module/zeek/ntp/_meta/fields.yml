    Fields exported by the Zeek NTP log.
  fields:
    - name: version
      type: integer
      description: >
        The NTP version number (1, 2, 3, 4).
    - name: mode
      type: integer
      description: >
        The NTP mode being used.
    - name: stratum
      type: integer
      description: >
        The stratum (primary server, secondary server, etc.).
    - name: poll
      type: double
      description: >
        The maximum interval between successive messages in seconds.
    - name: precision
      type: double
      description: >
        The precision of the system clock in seconds.
    - name: root_delay
      type: double
      description: >
        Total round-trip delay to the reference clock in seconds.
    - name: root_disp
      type: double
      description: >
        Total dispersion to the reference clock in seconds.
    - name: ref_id
      type: keyword
      description: >
        For stratum 0, 4 character string used for debugging.
        For stratum 1, ID assigned to the reference clock by IANA.
        Above stratum 1, when using IPv4, the IP address of the reference clock.
        Note that the NTP protocol did not originally specify a large enough field to represent IPv6 addresses,
        so they use the first four bytes of the MD5 hash of the reference clockâ€™s IPv6 address
        (i.e. an IPv4 address here is not necessarily IPv4).
    - name: ref_time
      type: date
      description: >
        Time when the system clock was last set or correct.
    - name: org_time
      type: date
      description: >
        Time at the client when the request departed for the NTP server.
    - name: rec_time
      type: date
      description: >
        Time at the server when the request arrived from the NTP client.
    - name: xmt_time
      type: date
      description: >
        Time at the server when the response departed for the NTP client.
    - name: num_exts
      type: integer
      description: >
