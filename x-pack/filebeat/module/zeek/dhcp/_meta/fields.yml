        Addresses seen in this DHCP exchange.
      fields:

          description: >
            IP address assigned by the server.

        - name: client
          type: ip
          description: |
            IP address of the client. If a transaction is only a client sending
            INFORM messages then there is no lease information exchanged so this
            is helpful to know who sent the messages. Getting an address in this
            field does require that the client sources at least one DHCP message
            using a non-broadcast address.

            Added by DHCP relay agents which terminate switched or permanent
            circuits. It encodes an agent-local identifier of the circuit from
            which a DHCP client-to-server packet was received. Typically it
            should represent a router or switch interface number.

        - name: remote_agent
          type: keyword
          description: |
            (present if policy/protocols/dhcp/sub-opts.bro is loaded)
            A globally unique identifier added by relay agents to identify the
            remote host end of the circuit.

            (present if policy/protocols/dhcp/sub-opts.bro is loaded)
            The subscriber ID is a value independent of the physical network
            configuration so that a customer's DHCP configuration can be given
            to them correctly no matter where they are physically connected.
