        This field is populated only when the activity that this event monitors requires extra authentication, such as multi-factor authentication. In this case, Salesforce generates more events and sets the RelatedEventIdentifier field of the new events to the value of the EventIdentifier field of the original event. Use this field with the EventIdentifier field to correlate all the related events. If no extra authentication is required, this field is blank.

        Represents an ID value that is populated by the system and refers to the position of the event in the event stream. Replay ID values arenâ€™t guaranteed to be contiguous for consecutive events. A subscriber can store a replay ID value and use it on resubscription to retrieve missed events that are within the retention window.
