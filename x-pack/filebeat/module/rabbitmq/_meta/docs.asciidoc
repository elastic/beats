=== Example dashboard

This module comes with a sample dashboard. For example:

TODO: include an image of a sample dashboard. If you do not include a dashboard,
remove this section and set `:has-dashboards: false` at the top of this file.

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

TODO: provide an example configuration

:fileset_ex: {fileset}

include::../include/config-option-intro.asciidoc[]

TODO: document the variables from each fileset. If you're describing a variable
that's common to other modules, you can reuse shared descriptions by including
the relevant file. For example:

[float]
==== `{fileset}` log fileset settings

include::../include/var-paths.asciidoc[]
