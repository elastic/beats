                The event log API type used to read the record. The possible values are
                "wineventlog" for the Windows Event Log API or "wineventlog-experimental" for its
                experimental implementation.

                A globally unique identifier that identifies the current activity. The
                events that are published with this identifier are part of the same

                The event-specific data. This field is mutually exclusive with
                `user_data`. If you are capturing event data on versions prior
                to Windows Vista, the parameters in `event_data` are named `param1`,
                `param2`, and so on, because event log parameters are unnamed in
                earlier versions of Windows.
