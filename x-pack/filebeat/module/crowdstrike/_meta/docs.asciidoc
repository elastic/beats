== Crowdstrike module

This is the filebeat module for the Crowdstrike Falcon using the Falcon [SIEM connector](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/integrate-with-your-siem/). By default, the Falcon SIEM connector outputs JSON formated Falcon Streaming API event data in JSON format. This module collects this data, converts it to ECS, and ingests it to view in the SIEM.

=== Example dashboard

This module comes with a sample dashboard. For example:

TODO: include an image of a sample dashboard. If you do not include a dashboard,
remove this section and set `:has-dashboards: false` at the top of this file.

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

The fileset is by default configured to collect JSON formated event data from `/var/log/crowdstrike/falconhoseclient/output`.

  - name: paths
    default:
      - /var/log/crowdstrike/falconhoseclient/output

:fileset_ex: {fileset}

include::../include/config-option-intro.asciidoc[]

TODO: document the variables from each fileset. If you're describing a variable
that's common to other modules, you can reuse shared descriptions by including
the relevant file. For example:

==== `{fileset}` log fileset settings
