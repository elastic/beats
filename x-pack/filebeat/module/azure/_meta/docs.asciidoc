== azure module

beta[]

This is the azure module.

The azure module will concentrate on retrieving different types of log data from Azure.
The module will contain the following filesets:

`activitylogs` ::
Will retrieve azure activity logs. Control-plane events on Azure Resource Manager resources. Activity logs provide insight into the operations that were performed on resources in your subscription.

`signinlogs` ::
Will retrieve azure Active Directory sign-in logs. The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

`auditlogs` ::
Will retrieve azure Active Directory audit logs. The audit logs provide traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

```
- module: azure
  activitylogs:
    enabled: true
    var:
      namespace: "obseventhubs.servicebus.windows.net:9093"
      eventhub: ["insights-operational-logs"]
      consumer_group: "$Default"
      connection_string: ""
   auditlogs:
     enabled: true
     var:
       namespace: ""
       eventhub: ["insights-logs-auditlogs"]
       consumer_group: "$Default"
       connection_string: ""

   signinlogs:
     enabled: true
     var:
       namespace: ""
       eventhub: ["insights-logs-signinlogs"]
       consumer_group: "$Default"
       connection_string: ""

```


A side by side kafka/event hubs notation, we will follow Azure notations in this case.


`namespace` ::
_string_
An Event Hubs namespace provides a unique scoping container, referenced by its fully qualified domain name, in which users can create one or more event hubs or Kafka topics.

`eventhub` ::
  _[]string_
Or kafka topic, is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service.
Default value `insights-operational-logs`

`consumer_group` ::
_string_
 The publish/subscribe mechanism of Event Hubs is enabled through consumer groups. A consumer group is a view (state, position, or offset) of an entire event hub. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream independently at their own pace and with their own offsets.
Default value: `$Default`

`connection_string` ::
_string_
The connection string required to communicate with Event Hubs, steps here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string.
