abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 20344(26652) for channel
'LOGSTASH' ended abnormally. The host name is 'felix-elastic (127.0.0.1)'; in
some cases the host name cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be
found in the System Administration Guide.

AMQ5540: Application 'org.logstash.Logstash' did not supply a user ID and
password

EXPLANATION:
The queue manager is configured to require a user ID and password, but none was
supplied.
ACTION:
Ensure that the application provides a valid user ID and password, or change
the queue manager configuration to OPTIONAL to allow applications to connect
which have not supplied a user ID and password.

AMQ5541: The failed authentication check was caused by the queue manager
CONNAUTH CHCKCLNT(REQDADM) configuration.

EXPLANATION:
The user ID 'felix' and its password were checked because the user ID is
privileged and the queue manager connection authority (CONNAUTH) configuration
refers to an authentication information (AUTHINFO) object named
'SYSTEM.DEFAULT.AUTHINFO.IDPWOS' with CHCKCLNT(REQDADM). 

This message accompanies a previous error to clarify the reason for the user ID
and password check.
ACTION:
Refer to the previous error for more information. 

Ensure that a password is specified by the client application and that the
password is correct for the user ID. The authentication configuration of the
queue manager connection determines the user ID repository. For example, the
local operating system user database or an LDAP server. 

To avoid the authentication check, you can either use an unprivileged user ID
or amend the authentication configuration of the queue manager. You can amend
the CHCKCLNT attribute in the CHLAUTH record, but you should generally not
allow unauthenticated remote access.

test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'test' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'test' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'test' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'test' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'test' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'test' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'test' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'test' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

configuration.
ACTION:
Ensure that DNS is correctly configured on the local system. 

If the address was an IP address then the slow operation was a reverse DNS
lookup. Some DNS configurations are not capable of reverse DNS lookups and some
IP addresses have no valid reverse DNS entries. If the problem persists,
consider disabling reverse DNS lookups until the issue with the DNS can be
resolved.

AMQ9788: Slow DNS lookup for address 'test'.

EXPLANATION:
An attempt to resolve address 'test' using the 'getaddrinfo' function call took
7 seconds to complete. This might indicate a problem with the DNS
configuration.
ACTION:
Ensure that DNS is correctly configured on the local system. 

If the address was an IP address then the slow operation was a reverse DNS
lookup. Some DNS configurations are not capable of reverse DNS lookups and some
IP addresses have no valid reverse DNS entries. If the problem persists,
consider disabling reverse DNS lookups until the issue with the DNS can be
resolved.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is 0
(X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
An attempt to resolve address 'test' using the 'getaddrinfo' function call took
7 seconds to complete. This might indicate a problem with the DNS
configuration.
ACTION:
Ensure that DNS is correctly configured on the local system. 

If the address was an IP address then the slow operation was a reverse DNS
lookup. Some DNS configurations are not capable of reverse DNS lookups and some
IP addresses have no valid reverse DNS entries. If the problem persists,
consider disabling reverse DNS lookups until the issue with the DNS can be
resolved.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is 0
(X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
An attempt to resolve address 'test' using the 'getaddrinfo' function call took
7 seconds to complete. This might indicate a problem with the DNS
configuration.
ACTION:
Ensure that DNS is correctly configured on the local system. 

If the address was an IP address then the slow operation was a reverse DNS
lookup. Some DNS configurations are not capable of reverse DNS lookups and some
IP addresses have no valid reverse DNS entries. If the problem persists,
consider disabling reverse DNS lookups until the issue with the DNS can be
resolved.

AMQ9788: Slow DNS lookup for address 'test'.

EXPLANATION:
An attempt to resolve address 'test' using the 'getaddrinfo' function call took
6 seconds to complete. This might indicate a problem with the DNS
configuration.
ACTION:
Ensure that DNS is correctly configured on the local system. 

If the address was an IP address then the slow operation was a reverse DNS
lookup. Some DNS configurations are not capable of reverse DNS lookups and some
IP addresses have no valid reverse DNS entries. If the problem persists,
consider disabling reverse DNS lookups until the issue with the DNS can be
resolved.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is 0
(X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202: Remote host 'test' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'test' to host 'test' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 4288(18184) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'test' to host 'test' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 20820(7108) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

The channel program running under process ID 23512(26648) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be
found in the System Administration Guide.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'test' to host 'test' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 23512(28560) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.

Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'test' to host 'test' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 27248(21692) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be
found in the System Administration Guide.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'test' to host 'test' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 20748(6968) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'test' to host 'test' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 6964(18416) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be
found in the System Administration Guide.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'test' to host 'test' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 35276(39508) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'test' to host 'test' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 33612(27652) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be
found in the System Administration Guide.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'test' to host 'test' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 39700(30912) for channel 'test'
ended abnormally. The host name is 'test'; in some cases the host name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'test' for channel
test was not successful. However the error may be a transitory one and it may
be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
11001 (X'0'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'test' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the relevant operations
to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
During the processing of channel 'CHL.QM2.QM1' one or more messages could not
be put to the destination queue and attempts were made to put them to a
dead-letter queue.  The location of the queue is 1, where 1 is the local
dead-letter queue and 2 is the remote dead-letter queue.
ACTION:
Examine the contents of the dead-letter queue.  Each message is contained in a
structure that describes why the message was put to the queue, and to where it
was originally addressed. Also look at previous error messages to see if the
attempt to put messages to a dead-letter queue failed. The program identifier
(PID) of the processing program was '38088(40732)'.

AMQ9544W: Messages not put to destination queue.

EXPLANATION:
During the processing of channel 'CHL.QM2.QM1' one or more messages could not
be put to the destination queue and attempts were made to put them to a
dead-letter queue.  The location of the queue is 1, where 1 is the local
dead-letter queue and 2 is the remote dead-letter queue.
ACTION:
Examine the contents of the dead-letter queue.  Each message is contained in a
structure that describes why the message was put to the queue, and to where it
was originally addressed. Also look at previous error messages to see if the
attempt to put messages to a dead-letter queue failed. The program identifier
(PID) of the processing program was '38088(23404)'.

AMQ9544W: Messages not put to destination queue.

EXPLANATION:
During the processing of channel 'CHL.QM2.QM1' one or more messages could not
be put to the destination queue and attempts were made to put them to a
dead-letter queue.  The location of the queue is 1, where 1 is the local
dead-letter queue and 2 is the remote dead-letter queue.
ACTION:
Examine the contents of the dead-letter queue.  Each message is contained in a
structure that describes why the message was put to the queue, and to where it
was originally addressed. Also look at previous error messages to see if the
attempt to put messages to a dead-letter queue failed. The program identifier
(PID) of the processing program was '38088(33892)'.

AMQ9544W: Messages not put to destination queue.

EXPLANATION:
During the processing of channel 'CHL.QM2.QM1' one or more messages could not
be put to the destination queue and attempts were made to put them to a
dead-letter queue.  The location of the queue is 1, where 1 is the local
dead-letter queue and 2 is the remote dead-letter queue.
ACTION:
Examine the contents of the dead-letter queue.  Each message is contained in a
structure that describes why the message was put to the queue, and to where it
was originally addressed. Also look at previous error messages to see if the
attempt to put messages to a dead-letter queue failed. The program identifier
(PID) of the processing program was '38088(117404)'.
