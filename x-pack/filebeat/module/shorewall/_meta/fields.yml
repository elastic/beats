            The Urgent Pointer allows for urgent, "out of band" data transfer.

            The TCP Receive Window size. This may be scaled by bit-shifting left
            by a number of bits specified in the "Window Scale" TCP option.
            If the host supports ECN, then the TCP Receive Window size will also
            be controlled by that.
