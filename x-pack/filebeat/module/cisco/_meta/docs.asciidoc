== Cisco module

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/integration-link.asciidoc[]

This is a module for Cisco network device's logs and Cisco Umbrella. It includes the following
filesets for receiving logs over syslog or read from a file:

- `asa` fileset: supports Cisco ASA firewall logs.
- `amp` fileset: supports Cisco AMP API logs.
- `ftd` fileset: supports Cisco Firepower Threat Defense logs.
- `ios` fileset: supports Cisco IOS router and switch logs.
- `nexus` fileset: supports Cisco Nexus switch logs.
- `meraki` fileset: supports Cisco Meraki logs.
- `umbrella` fileset: supports Cisco Umbrella logs.

Cisco ASA devices also support exporting flow records using NetFlow, which is
supported by the {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-netflow.html[netflow module] in
{beatname_uc}.

include::../include/what-happens.asciidoc[]

include::../include/gs-link.asciidoc[]

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

The module is by default configured to run via syslog on port 9001 for ASA and
port 9002 for IOS. However it can also be configured to read from a file path.
See the following example.

Cisco Umbrella publishes its logs in a compressed CSV format to a S3 bucket.

==== `asa` fileset settings

Example config:

[source,yaml]
----
- module: cisco
  asa:
    var.syslog_host: 0.0.0.0
    var.syslog_port: 9001
    var.log_level: 5
----

include::../include/var-paths.asciidoc[]

*`var.log_level`*::

An integer between 1 and 7 that allows to filter messages based on the
severity level. The different severity levels supported by the Cisco ASA are:

[width="30%",cols="^1,2",options="header"]
|===========================
| log_level | severity
|     1     | Alert
|     2     | Critical
|     3     | Error
|     4     | Warning
|     5     | Notification
|     6     | Informational
|     7     | Debugging
|===========================

A value of 7 (default) will not filter any messages. A lower value will drop
any messages with a severity level higher than the specified value. For
example, `var.log_level: 3` will allow messages of level 1 (Alert), 2 (Critical)
and 3 (Error). All other messages will be dropped.

*`var.syslog_host`*::

The interface to listen to UDP based syslog traffic. Defaults to localhost.
Set to 0.0.0.0 to bind to all available interfaces.

*`var.syslog_port`*::

The UDP port to listen for syslog traffic. Defaults to 9001.

*`var.tags`*::

A list of tags to include in events. Including `forwarded` indicates that the
events did not originate on this host and causes `host.name` to not be added to
events. Defaults to `[cisco-asa, forwarded]`.

==== `ftd` fileset settings

The Cisco FTD fileset primarily supports parsing IPv4 and IPv6 access list log
messages similar to that of ASA devices as well as Security Event Syslog
Messages for Intrusion, Connection, File and Malware events.

*Field mappings*

The `ftd` fileset maps Security Event Syslog Messages to the Elastic Common
Schema (ECS) format. The following table illustrates the mapping from
Security Event fields to ECS. The `cisco.ftd` prefix is used when there is no
corresponding ECS field available.

==== `nexus` fileset settings

experimental[]

NOTE: This was converted from RSA NetWitness log parser XML "cisconxos" device revision 134.

*`var.input`*::

The input from which messages are read. One of `file`, `tcp` or `udp`. Defaults to `udp`.

*`var.syslog_host`*::

The address to listen to UDP or TCP based syslog traffic.

*`var.tz_offset`*::

By default, datetimes in the logs will be interpreted as relative to
the timezone configured in the host where {beatname_uc} is running. If ingesting
logs from a host on a different timezone, use this field to set the timezone
offset so that datetimes are correctly parsed. Valid values are in the form
±HH:mm, for example, `-07:00` for `UTC-7`.

Flag to control the addition of non-ECS fields to the event. Defaults to true,
which causes both ECS and custom fields under `rsa` to be added.

*`var.keep_raw_fields`*::

Flag to control the addition of the raw parser fields to the event. This fields
will be found under `rsa.raw`. The default is false.

==== `umbrella` fileset settings

The Cisco Umbrella fileset primarily focuses on reading CSV files from an S3 bucket using the filebeat S3 input.

To configure Cisco Umbrella to log to a self-managed S3 bucket please follow the https://docs.umbrella.com/deployment-umbrella/docs/log-management[Cisco Umbrella User Guide], and the link:filebeat-input-aws-s3.html[AWS S3 input documentation] to setup the necessary Amazon SQS queue.  Retrieving logs from a Cisco-managed S3 bucket is not currently supported.

This fileset supports all 4 log types:
- Proxy
- Cloud Firewall
- IP Logs
- DNS logs

The Cisco Umbrella fileset depends on the original file path structure being followed. This structure is documented https://docs.umbrella.com/deployment-umbrella/docs/log-formats-and-versioning[Umbrella Log Formats and Versioning]:

<subfolder>/<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>/<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>-<hh>-<mm>-<xxxx>.csv.gz
dnslogs/<year>-<month>-<day>/<year>-<month>-<day>-<hour>-<minute>.csv.gz


Example config:

[source,yaml]
----
- module: cisco
  umbrella:
    enabled: true
    var.input: aws-s3
    var.queue_url: https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ID/CiscoQueue
    var.access_key_id: 123456
    var.secret_access_key: PASSWORD
----

*`var.input`*::

The input from which messages are read. Can be S3 or file.

*`var.queue_url`*::

The URL to the SQS queue if the input type is S3.

*`var.access_key_id`*::

The ID for the access key used to read from the SQS queue.

*`var.secret_access_key`*::

The secret token used for authenticating to the SQS queue.

*`var.visibility_timeout`*::

The duration that the received messages are hidden from ReceiveMessage request.
Default to be 300 seconds.

*`var.api_timeout`*::

Maximum duration before AWS API request will be interrupted. Default to be 120 seconds.

==== `amp` fileset settings

The Cisco AMP fileset focuses on collecting events from your Cisco AMP/Cisco Secure Endpoint API.

To configure the Cisco AMP fileset you will need to retrieve your `client_id` and `api_key` from the AMP dashboard.
For more information on how to retrieve these credentials, please reference the https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/api_resources?api_host=api.amp.cisco.com&api_version=v1[Cisco AMP API documentation].

The URL configured for the API depends on which region your AMP is located, currently there are three choices:
- api.amp.cisco.com
- api.apjc.amp.cisco.com
- api.eu.amp.cisco.com

If new endpoints are added by Cisco in the future, please reference the API URL list located at the https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/[Cisco AMP API Docs].

Example config:

[source,yaml]
----
- module: cisco
  amp:
    enabled: true
    var.input: httpjson
    var.url: https://api.amp.cisco.com/v1/events
    var.client_id: 123456
    var.api_key: sfda987gdf90s0df0
----

When starting up the Filebeat module for the first time, you are able to configure how far back you want Filebeat to collect existing events from.
It is also possible to select how often Filebeat will check the Cisco AMP API. Another example below which looks back 200 hours and have a custom timeout:

[source,yaml]
----
- module: cisco
  amp:
    enabled: true
    var.input: httpjson
    var.url: https://api.amp.cisco.com/v1/events
    var.client_id: 123456
    var.api_key: sfda987gdf90s0df0
    var.first_interval: 200h
    var.interval: 60m
    var.request_timeout: 120s
    var.limit: 100

----

*`var.input`*::

The input from which messages are read. Supports httpjson.

*`var.url`*::

The URL to the Cisco AMP API endpoint, this url value depends on your region. It will be the same region as your Cisco AMP Dashboard URL.

*`var.client_id`*::

The ID for the user account used to access the API.

*`var.api_key`*::

The API secret used together with the related client_id.

*`var.request_timeout`*::

When handling large influxes of events, especially for large enterprises, the API might take longer to respond. This value is to set a custom
timeout value for each request sent by Filebeat.

*`var.first_interval`*::

How far back you would want to collect events the first time the Filebeat module starts up. Supports amount in hours(example: 24h), minutes(example: 10m) and seconds(example: 50s).

*`var.limit`*::

This value controls how many events are returned by the Cisco AMP API per page.
