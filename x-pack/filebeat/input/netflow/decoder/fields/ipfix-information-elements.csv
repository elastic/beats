As the most significant 4 bits of octets 12 and 13 (counting from
zero) of the TCP header [RFC793] are used to encode the TCP data
offset (header length), the corresponding bits in this Information
Element MUST be exported as zero and MUST be ignored by the
collector.  Use the tcpHeaderLength Information Element to encode
this value.

            
            
              
Each of the 3 bits (0x800, 0x400, and 0x200), which are reserved
for future use in [RFC793], SHOULD be exported as observed in the
TCP headers of the packets of this Flow.

            
            
              
If exported as a single octet with reduced-size encoding, this
Information Element covers the low-order octet of this field (i.e,
bits 0x80 to 0x01), omitting the ECN Nonce Sum and the three
Future Use bits.  A collector receiving this Information Element
with reduced-size encoding must not assume anything about the
content of these four bits.

            
            
              
Exporting Processes exporting this Information Element on behalf
of a Metering Process that is not capable of observing any of the
ECN Nonce Sum or Future Use bits SHOULD use reduced-size encoding,
and only export the least significant 8 bits of this Information
Element.

            
            
              
Note that previous revisions of this Information Element's
definition specified that the CWR and ECE bits must be exported as
zero, even if observed.  Collectors should therefore not assume
that a value of zero for these bits in this Information Element
indicates the bits were never set in the observed traffic,

given exporter.",,,[RFC793][RFC3168][RFC3540],[RFC7125],1,2014-01-03

The Stability Class portion of this flags word describes the
stability class of the anonymization technique applied to a
referenced Information Element within a referenced Template.
Stability classes refer to the stability of the parameters of the
anonymization technique, and therefore the comparability of the
mapping between the real and anonymized values over time.  This
determines which anonymized datasets may be compared with each
other.  Values are as follows:

| Value | Description                                               |
+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| 0     | Unspecified: The counters for an Original Flow are        |
|       | explicitly not distributed according to any other method  |
|       | defined for this Information Element; use for arbitrary   |
|       | distribution, or distribution algorithms not described by |
|       | any other codepoint.                                      |
|       | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|       |                                                           |
| 1     | Start Interval: The counters for an Original Flow are     |
|       | added to the counters of the appropriate Aggregated Flow  |
|       | containing the start time of the Original Flow.  This     |
|       | should be assumed the default if value distribution       |
|       | information is not available at a Collecting Process for  |
|       | an Aggregated Flow.                                       |

|       |                                                           |
| 2     | End Interval: The counters for an Original Flow are added |
|       | to the counters of the appropriate Aggregated Flow        |
|       | containing the end time of the Original Flow.             |
|       | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|       |                                                           |
| 3     | Mid Interval: The counters for an Original Flow are added |
|       | to the counters of a single appropriate Aggregated Flow   |
|       | containing some timestamp between start and end time of   |
|       | the Original Flow.                                        |
|       | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|       |                                                           |
| 4     | Simple Uniform Distribution: Each counter for an Original |
|       | Flow is divided by the number of time intervals the       |
|       | Original Flow covers (i.e., of appropriate Aggregated     |
|       | Flows sharing the same Flow Key), and this number is      |
|       | added to each corresponding counter in each Aggregated    |
|       | Flow.                                                     |
|       | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|       |                                                           |
| 5     | Proportional Uniform Distribution: Each counter for an    |
|       | Original Flow is divided by the number of time units the  |
|       | Original Flow covers, to derive a mean count rate.  This  |
|       | mean count rate is then multiplied by the number of time  |
|       | units in the intersection of the duration of the Original |
|       | Flow and the time interval of each Aggregated Flow.  This |
|       | is like simple uniform distribution, but accounts for the |
|       | fractional portions of a time interval covered by an      |
|       | Original Flow in the first and last time interval.        |
|       | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|       |                                                           |
| 6     | Simulated Process: Each counter of the Original Flow is   |
|       | distributed among the intervals of the Aggregated Flows   |
|       | according to some function the Intermediate Aggregation   |
|       | Process uses based upon properties of Flows presumed to   |
|       | be like the Original Flow.  This is essentially an        |
|       | assertion that the Intermediate Aggregation Process has   |
|       | no direct packet timing information but is nevertheless   |
|       | not using one of the other simpler distribution methods.  |
|       | The Intermediate Aggregation Process specifically makes   |
|       | no assertion as to the correctness of the simulation.     |
|       | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|       |                                                           |
| 7     | Direct: The Intermediate Aggregation Process has access   |
|       | to the original packet timings from the packets making up |
|       | the Original Flow, and uses these to distribute or        |
|       | recalculate the counters.                                 |
