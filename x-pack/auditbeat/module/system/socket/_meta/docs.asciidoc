This is the `socket` dataset of the system module.

[float]
=== Implementation

It is implemented for Linux only.

On Linux, the dataset uses the
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sock_diag.7.html[sock_diag netlink subsystem]
to periodically receive a list of all sockets from the kernel. The polling frequency
can be set using the `period` configuration option. A low value (e.g. `1s`) is
recommended to capture short-lived sockets.

By default, sockets from or to `localhost` will be excluded. This can be controlled using
the `socket.include_localhost` configuration option.

==== Example dashboard

The dataset comes with a sample dashboard:
