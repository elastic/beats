== System Module

beta[]

The `system` module collects various security related information about
a system. All datasets send both periodic state information (e.g. all currently
running processes) and real-time changes (e.g. when a new process starts
or stops).

The module is fully implemented for Linux on x86. Currently, the `socket` module is not available on ARM. Some datasets are also available
for macOS (Darwin) and Windows.

[float]
=== How it works

Each dataset sends two kinds of information: state and events.

State information is sent periodically and (for some datasets) on startup.
A state update will consist of one event per object that is currently
active on the system (e.g. a process). All events belonging to the same state
update will share the same UUID in `event.id`.

The frequency of state updates can be controlled for all datasets using the
`state.period` configuration option. Overrides are available per dataset.
The default is `12h`.

Event information is sent as the events occur (e.g. a process starts or stops).
All datasets are currently using a poll model to retrieve their data.
The frequency of these polls is controlled by the `period` configuration
parameter.

[float]
==== Entity IDs

This module populates `entity_id` fields to uniquely identify entities (users,
packages, processes...) within a host. This requires {beatname_uc}
to obtain a unique identifier for the host:

- Windows: Uses the `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid` registry
key.
- macOS: Uses the value returned by `gethostuuid(2)` system call.
- Linux: Uses the content of one of the following files, created by either
`systemd` or `dbus`:
 * /etc/machine-id
 * /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
 * /var/db/dbus/machine-id

NOTE: Under CentOS 6.x, it's possible that none of the files above exist.
In that case, running `dbus-uuidgen --ensure` (provided by the `dbus` package)
will generate one for you.

==== Example dashboard

The module comes with a sample dashboard:

=== Configuration options

This module has some configuration options for controlling its behavior. The
following example shows all configuration options with their default values for
Linux.

NOTE: It is recommended to configure some datasets separately. See below for a
sample suggested configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
- module: system
  datasets:
    - host
    - login
    - package
    - process
    - socket
    - user
  period: 10s
  state.period: 12h

  socket.include_localhost: false

  user.detect_password_changes: true
----

This module also supports the
<<module-standard-options-{modulename},standard configuration options>>
described later.

*`state.period`*:: The interval at which the datasets send full state information.
This option can be overridden per dataset using `{dataset}.state.period`.

*`user.detect_password_changes`*:: If the `user` dataset is configured and
this option is set to `true`, Auditbeat will read password information in `/etc/passwd`
and `/etc/shadow` to detect password changes. A hash will be kept locally in
the `beat.db` file to detect changes between Auditbeat restarts. The `beat.db` file
should be readable only by the root user and be treated similar to the shadow file
itself.

[float]
=== Suggested configuration

Processes and sockets can be short-lived, so the chance of missing an update
increases if the polling interval is too large.

On the other hand, host and user information is unlikely to change frequently,
so a longer polling interval can be used.

[source,yaml]
----
- module: system
  datasets:
    - host
    - login
    - package
    - user
  period: 1m

  user.detect_password_changes: true

- module: system
  datasets:
    - process
    - socket
  period: 1s

[float]
=== Example configuration

The System module supports the common configuration options that are
described under <<configuration-{beatname_lc},configuring {beatname_uc}>>. Here
is an example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
auditbeat.modules:
- module: system
  datasets:
    - package # Installed, updated, and removed packages

  period: 2m # The frequency at which the datasets check for changes

- module: system
  datasets:
    - host    # General host information, e.g. uptime, IPs
    - login   # User logins, logouts, and system boots.
    - process # Started and stopped processes
    - socket  # Opened and closed sockets
    - user    # User information

  # How often datasets send state updates with the
  # current state of the system (e.g. all currently
  # running processes, all open sockets).
  state.period: 12h

  # Enabled by default. Auditbeat will read password fields in
  # /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow and store a hash locally to
  # detect any changes.
  user.detect_password_changes: true

  # File patterns of the login record files.
  login.wtmp_file_pattern: /var/log/wtmp*
  login.btmp_file_pattern: /var/log/btmp*
