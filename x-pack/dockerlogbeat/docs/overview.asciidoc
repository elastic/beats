The {log-driver} is a Docker plugin that sends container logs to the
https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack[{stack}], where you can search, analyze,
and visualize the data in real time.

The {log-driver} is built on top of the https://www.elastic.co/beats[{beats}]
platform and supports many of the features and outputs supported by the
{beats} shippers.
