    **Deprecated.** This view is deprecated in favor of the elastic_host_users table.
    It exists only for backward compatibility (SELECT * FROM elastic_host_users).
    Use elastic_host_users directly in new use cases.
  examples:
    - title: Query host users (same as elastic_host_users)
      query: |
        SELECT * FROM host_users;
