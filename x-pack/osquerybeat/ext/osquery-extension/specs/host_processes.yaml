    **Deprecated.** This view is deprecated in favor of the elastic_host_processes table.
    It exists only for backward compatibility (SELECT * FROM elastic_host_processes).
    Use elastic_host_processes directly in new use cases.
  examples:
    - title: Query host processes (same as elastic_host_processes)
      query: |
        SELECT * FROM host_processes;
  notes:
    - "Deprecated in favor of elastic_host_processes; use the table directly for new queries."
