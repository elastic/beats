# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
# combination of these.
#fields:
#  env: staging

# If this option is set to true, the custom fields are stored as top-level
# fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields
# sub-dictionary. Default is false.

# Internal queue configuration for buffering events to be published.
#queue:
  # Queue type by name (default 'mem')
  # The memory queue will present all available events (up to the outputs
  # bulk_max_size) to the output, the moment the output is ready to server
  # another batch of events.
  #mem:
    # Max number of events the queue can buffer.
    #events: 4096

    # Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,
    # before providing a batch of events to the outputs.
    # The default value is set to 2048.
    # A value of 0 ensures events are immediately available
    # to be sent to the outputs.
    #flush.min_events: 2048

    # Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
    # if the number of events stored in the queue is < `flush.min_events`.
    #flush.timeout: 1s

  # The disk queue stores incoming events on disk until the output is
  # ready for them. This allows a higher event limit than the memory-only
  # queue and lets pending events persist through a restart.
  #disk:
    # The directory path to store the queue's data.
    #path: "${path.data}/diskqueue"

    # The maximum space the queue should occupy on disk. Depending on
    # input settings, events that exceed this limit are delayed or discarded.
    #max_size: 10GB

    # The maximum size of a single queue data file. Data in the queue is
    # stored in smaller segments that are deleted after all their events
    # have been processed.
    #segment_size: 1GB

    # The number of events to read from disk to memory while waiting for
    # the output to request them.

    # The duration to wait before retrying when the queue encounters a disk
    # write error.
    #retry_interval: 1s

    # The maximum length of time to wait before retrying on a disk write
    # error. If the queue encounters repeated errors, it will double the
    # length of its retry interval each time, up to this maximum.
    #max_retry_interval: 30s

  # The spool queue will store events in a local spool file, before
  # forwarding the events to the outputs.
  # Note: the spool queue is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  # Use the disk queue instead.
  #
  # The spool file is a circular buffer, which blocks once the file/buffer is full.
  # Events are put into a write buffer and flushed once the write buffer
  # is full or the flush_timeout is triggered.
  # Once ACKed by the output, events are removed immediately from the queue,
  # making space for new events to be persisted.
  #spool:
    # The file namespace configures the file path and the file creation settings.
    # Once the file exists, the `size`, `page_size` and `prealloc` settings
    # will have no more effect.
    #file:

      # truncate. The default value is true.
      #prealloc: true

    # Spool writer settings
    # Events are serialized into a write buffer. The write buffer is flushed if:
    # - The buffer limit has been reached.
    # - The configured limit of buffered events is reached.
    # - The flush timeout is triggered.
    #write:
      # Sets the write buffer size.
      #buffer_size: 1MiB

      # Maximum duration after which events are flushed if the write buffer
      # is not full yet. The default value is 1s.

      # Number of maximum buffered events. The write buffer is flushed once the
      # limit is reached.
      #flush.events: 16384

      # Configure the on-disk event encoding. The encoding can be changed
      # between restarts.
      # Valid encodings are: json, ubjson, and cbor.
      #codec: cbor
    #read:
      # Reader flush timeout, waiting for more events to become available, so
      # to fill a complete batch as required by the outputs.

      #flush.timeout: 0s

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. The
# default is the number of logical CPUs available in the system.

# ================================= Processors =================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#  - include_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu"]
#  - drop_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#  - drop_event:
#      when:
#        equals:
#          http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#  - rename:
#      fields:
#        - from: "a"
#          to: "b"
#
# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#
#processors:
#  - dissect:
#      tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#      field: "message"
#      target_prefix: "dissect"
#
# The following example enriches each event with metadata from the cloud
# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#  - add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#  - add_locale:
#      format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:
#
#processors:
#  - add_docker_metadata:
#      host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
#      match_fields: ["system.process.cgroup.id"]
#      match_pids: ["process.pid", "process.ppid"]
#      match_source: true
#      match_source_index: 4
#      match_short_id: false
#      cleanup_timeout: 60
#      labels.dedot: false
#      # To connect to Docker over TLS you must specify a client and CA certificate.
#      #ssl:
#      #  certificate_authority: "/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"
#      #  certificate:           "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
#      #  key:                   "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#  - add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:
#  - add_host_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#
#processors:
#  - add_process_metadata:
#      match_pids: ["system.process.ppid"]
#      target: system.process.parent
#
# The following example decodes fields containing JSON strings
# and replaces the strings with valid JSON objects.
#
#processors:
#  - decode_json_fields:
#      fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
#      process_array: false
#      max_depth: 1
#      target: ""
#      overwrite_keys: false
#
#processors:
#  - decompress_gzip_field:
#      from: "field1"
#      to: "field2"
#      ignore_missing: false
#      fail_on_error: true
#
# The following example copies the value of message to message_copied
#
#processors:
#  - copy_fields:
#      fields:
#        - from: message
#          to: message_copied
#      fail_on_error: true
#      ignore_missing: false
#
# The following example truncates the value of message to 1024 bytes
#
#processors:
#  - truncate_fields:
#      fields:
#        - message
#      max_bytes: 1024
#      fail_on_error: false
#      ignore_missing: true
#
# The following example preserves the raw message under event.original
#
#processors:
#  - copy_fields:
#      fields:
#        - from: message
#          to: event.original
#      fail_on_error: false
#      ignore_missing: true
#  - truncate_fields:
#      fields:
#        - event.original
#      max_bytes: 1024
#      fail_on_error: false
#      ignore_missing: true
#
# The following example URL-decodes the value of field1 to field2
#
#processors:
#  - urldecode:
#      fields:
#        - from: "field1"
#          to: "field2"
#      ignore_missing: false
#      fail_on_error: true

# =============================== Elastic Cloud ================================

# These settings simplify using Osquerybeat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).
