=== Deploy {beatname_uc} to your cloud provider

After configuring {beatname_uc} and defining cloud functions for the services
you want to monitor, deploy the functions to your cloud provider. To do this,
you can:

* <<manager-deployment,Use the {beatname_uc} manager>> (good for getting
  started), 
* Or <<own-deployment,use your own deployment infrastructure>>.

[[manager-deployment]]
==== Use the {beatname_uc} manager

Use the built-in manager to deploy, update, or delete {beatname_uc} functions
when you don't have your own deployment infrastructure or process in place.  

During deployment, the {beatname_uc} manager:

* Exports an AWS CloudFormation template. You can inspect the template by
running the <<export-command,`export`>> command.
* Creates a zip package that includes the function code and +{beatname_lc}.yml+
config file.
* Uploads the package to the specified cloud provider.

See <<{beatname_lc}-deploying>> in the getting started to learn how to deploy
functions by using the {beatname_uc} manager.

[[own-deployment]]
==== Use your own deployment infrastructure

If you don't want to use the {beatname_uc} manager, use your own deployment
infrastructure. To do this, create a package, then deploy it to your cloud
provider:

. Set the following environment variables:
+
`BEAT_STRICT_PERMS=false`:: This setting makes the function skip the ownership
check on the configuration file.
`ENABLED_FUNCTIONS=function-name-1,function-name-2`:: Specifies a comma-
separated list of functions that are enabled in the configuration file. For
example, to package functions called `my-kinesis` and `my-cloudwatch-logs`, run:
+
*linux and mac*:
+
[source, shell]
----
export BEAT_STRICT_PERMS=false
export ENABLED_FUNCTIONS=my-kinesis,my-cloudwatch-logs
----
+
*win*:
+
[source, shell]
----
set BEAT_STRICT_PERMS=false
set ENABLED_FUNCTIONS=my-kinesis,my-cloudwatch-logs
----
+
TIP: For easier management, we recommend having one Lambda per function. 

. Run the `package` command to package the functions and dependencies into an
archive. For example: 
+
*linux and mac:*
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./{beatname_lc} -v -e -d "*" package --output /path/to/file.zip
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
*win:*
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
.{backslash}{beatname_lc}.exe -v -e -d "*" package --output /path/to/file.zip
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
This command generates a deployment package (called `file.zip` in the example)
that contains:
+
* a binary, called `functionbeat-aws`, that contains the function code
* the `functionbeat.yml` config file
* `/tmp/functionbeat.keystore`, if a keystore is used

. If certificates are required, add the cert files to the zip package under the
same path as the configured +{beatname_lc}.yml+ file. 

. Deploy the package, using the infrastructure and automation supported by your
cloud provider. For example, to deploy the package to AWS,
<<export-cloudformation-template,export the AWS CloudFormation template>>
managed by {beatname_uc}, and modify it to work with your infrastructure.
