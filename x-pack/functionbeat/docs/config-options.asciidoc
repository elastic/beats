== Configure functions

{beatname_uc} runs as a function in your serverless environment.

Before deploying {beatname_uc}, you need to configure one or more functions and
specify details about the services that will trigger the functions.

You configure the functions in the the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ configuration file.
When you're done, you can <<{beatname_lc}-deploying,deploy the functions>>
to your serverless environment.

The following example configures two functions: `cloudwatch` and `sqs`. The
`cloudwatch` function collects events from CloudWatch Logs. The `sqs` function
collects messages from Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS). Both functions forward
the events to {es}.

[float]
=== Configuration options
You can specify the following options to configure the functions that you want
to deploy.

TIP: If you change the configuration after deploying the function, use
the <<update-command,`update` command>> to update your deployment.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-endpoint"]
==== `provider.aws.endpoint`

AWS endpoint to use in the URL template to load functions.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-deploy-bucket"]
==== `provider.aws.deploy_bucket`

A unique name for the S3 bucket that the Lambda artifact will be uploaded to.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-name"]
==== `name`

A unique name for the Lambda function. This is the name of the function as it
will appear in the Lambda console on AWS.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-type"]
==== `type`

The type of service to monitor. For this release, the supported types
are:

`cloudwatch_logs`:: Collects events from CloudWatch logs.
`sqs`:: Collects data from Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS).
`kinesis`:: Collects data from a Kinesis stream.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-description"]
==== `description`

A description of the function. This description is useful when you are running
multiple functions and need more context about how each function is used.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-triggers"]
==== `triggers`

A list of triggers that will cause the function to execute. The list of valid
triggers depends on the `type`. If `type` is `cloudwatch_logs` logs, specify a
list of log groups. If `type` is `sqs`, specify a list of Amazon Resource Names
(ARNs).

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-filter_pattern"]
==== `filter_pattern`

A regular expression that matches the events you want to collect. Setting this
option may reduce execution costs because the function only executes if there is
data that matches the pattern.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-concurrency"]
==== `concurrency`

The reserved number of instances for the function.  Setting this option may
reduce execution costs by limiting the number of functions that can execute in
your serverless environment. The default is unreserved.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-memory-size"]
==== `memory_size`

The maximum amount of memory to allocate for this function. Specify a value that
is a factor of 64. There is a hard limit of 3008 MiB for each function. The
default is 128 MiB.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-dead-letter-config"]
==== `dead_letter_config.target_arn`

The dead letter queue to use for messages that can't be processed successfully.
Set this option to an ARN that points to an SQS queue.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-batch-size"]
==== `batch_size`

The number of events to read from a Kinesis stream, the minimal values is 100 and the maximun is
10000. The default is 100.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-starting-position"]
==== `starting_position`

The starting position to read from a Kinesis stream, valids values are `trim_horizon` and `latest`.
The default is trim_horizon.
