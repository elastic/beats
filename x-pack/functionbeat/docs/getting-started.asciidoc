[id="{beatname_lc}-installation"]
=== Step 1: Download the {beatname_uc} package

The {beatname_uc} package contains the command line tools, configuration file,
and binary code required to run {beatname_uc} in your serverless environment. 

To download and extract the package, use the commands that work with your system.

TODO: Confirm and update paths.

. Download the {beatname_uc} Windows zip file from the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/{beatname_lc}[downloads page].

. Extract the contents of the zip file.

[id="{beatname_lc}-configuration"]
=== Step 2: Configure {beatname_uc}

Before deploying {beatname_uc} to your serverless environment, you need to
specify details about the functions that you want to deploy, including the
function name, type, and triggers that will invoke the function. You also need
to specify connection details for your {es} cluster. 

You specify settings in the  +{beatname_lc}.yml+ configuration file. This file
is located in the archive that you extracted earlier.

TIP: See the
{libbeat}/config-file-format.html[Config File Format] section of the
_Beats Platform Reference_ for more about the structure of the config file.

The following example configures a function called `myfunction` that collects
events from Cloudwatch Logs and forwards the events to {es}.

ADD EXAMPLE HERE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To configure {beatname_uc}:

. Define the functions that will execute in your serverless environment.
+
TODO: Explain what is required (name, type?, one or more triggers, etc. Will
need to desribe triggers somewhere else maybe and refer to those?

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]

[id="{beatname_lc}-starting"]
=== Step 5: Deploy {beatname_uc} code to your serverless environment

Before deploying functions to your serverless environment, make sure you're
logged in with the credentials required by your cloud service provider. 

QUESTION: Does the user need specific privileges to run functionbeat?

The following command deploys the function named `myfunction`. See xxx for more
information about the `deploy` command.

TODO: Add link that points to the command reference for more information.

QUESTION: Which flags do we want to show in the example here? debug selectors?

QUESTION: What happens to the Lambda function running on Amazon if you change
the configuration after deploying the function? 

*linux:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
{beatname_lc} function deploy myfunction
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*mac:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./{beatname_lc} function deploy myfunction
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*win:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > .\{beatname_lc}.exe function deploy myfunction
----------------------------------------------------------------------

{beatname_uc} is now deployed in your serverless environment and ready to send
log files to the output.

[[view-kibana-dashboards]]
=== Step 6: View the sample Kibana dashboards

To make it easier for you to explore {beatname_uc} data in Kibana, we've created
example {beatname_uc} dashboards. You loaded the dashboards earlier when you
ran the `setup` command.

include::{libbeat-dir}/docs/opendashboards.asciidoc[]

You can use these dashboards as examples and
{kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[customize] them to meet your needs.

To populate the example dashboards with data, you need to either
<<configuring-ingest-node,define ingest node pipelines>> or use Logstash to
parse the data into the fields expected by the dashboards. 

Here is an example of the {beatname_uc} ADD DASHBOARD NAME dashboard:
