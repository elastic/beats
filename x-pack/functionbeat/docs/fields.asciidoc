[[exported-fields-ecs]]
== ECS fields


This section defines Elastic Common Schema (ECS) fieldsâ€”a common set of fields
to be used when storing event data in {es}.

This is an exhaustive list, and fields listed here are not necessarily used by {beatname_uc}.
The goal of ECS is to enable and encourage users of {es} to normalize their event data,
so that they can better analyze, visualize, and correlate the data represented in their events.

See the {ecs-ref}[ECS reference] for more information.

*`@timestamp`*::
+
--
Date/time when the event originated.
This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
Required field for all events.

type: date

example: 2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z

required: True

--

*`labels`*::
+
--
Custom key/value pairs.
Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword.
Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.

type: object

example: {"application": "foo-bar", "env": "production"}

--

*`message`*::
+
--
For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

type: text

example: Hello World

--

*`tags`*::
+
--
List of keywords used to tag each event.

type: keyword

example: ["production", "env2"]

--

[float]
=== agent

The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.
Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.


*`agent.build.original`*::
+
--
Extended build information for the agent.
This field is intended to contain any build information that a data source may provide, no specific formatting is required.

type: keyword

example: metricbeat version 7.6.0 (amd64), libbeat 7.6.0 [6a23e8f8f30f5001ba344e4e54d8d9cb82cb107c built 2020-02-05 23:10:10 +0000 UTC]

--

*`agent.ephemeral_id`*::
+
--
Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).
This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not.

type: keyword

example: 8a4f500f

--

*`agent.id`*::
+
--
Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).
Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.

type: keyword

example: 8a4f500d

--

*`agent.name`*::
+
--
Custom name of the agent.
This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from.
If no name is given, the name is often left empty.

type: keyword

example: foo

--

*`agent.type`*::
+
--
Type of the agent.
The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine.

type: keyword

example: filebeat

--

*`agent.version`*::
+
--
Version of the agent.

type: keyword

example: 6.0.0-rc2

--

*`as.organization.name.text`*::
+
--
type: text

--

[float]
=== client

A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.
For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends the SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator or requestor in the network transaction. Some systems use the term "originator" to refer the client in TCP connections. The client fields describe details about the system acting as the client in the network event. Client fields are usually populated in conjunction with server fields. Client fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.
Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.


*`client.address`*::
+
--
Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.
Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.

[float]
=== data_stream

The data_stream fields take part in defining the new data stream naming scheme.
In the new data stream naming scheme the value of the data stream fields combine to the name of the actual data stream in the following manner: `{data_stream.type}-{data_stream.dataset}-{data_stream.namespace}`. This means the fields can only contain characters that are valid as part of names of data streams. More details about this can be found in this https://www.elastic.co/blog/an-introduction-to-the-elastic-data-stream-naming-scheme[blog post].
An Elasticsearch data stream consists of one or more backing indices, and a data stream name forms part of the backing indices names. Due to this convention, data streams must also follow index naming restrictions. For example, data stream names cannot include `\`, `/`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, ` ` (space character), `,`, or `#`. Please see the Elasticsearch reference for additional https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html#indices-create-api-path-params[restrictions].


*`data_stream.dataset`*::
+
--
The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data.
Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`.
Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:
  * Must not contain `-`
  * No longer than 100 characters

type: constant_keyword

example: nginx.access

--

*`data_stream.namespace`*::
+
--
A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data.
Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`.
Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:
  * Must not contain `-`
  * No longer than 100 characters

type: constant_keyword

example: production

--

*`data_stream.type`*::
+
--
An overarching type for the data stream.
Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future.

type: constant_keyword

example: logs

--

[float]
=== destination

Destination fields capture details about the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These fields are populated from a network event, packet, or other event containing details of a network transaction.
Destination fields are usually populated in conjunction with source fields. The source and destination fields are considered the baseline and should always be filled if an event contains source and destination details from a network transaction. If the event also contains identification of the client and server roles, then the client and server fields should also be populated.


*`destination.address`*::
+
--
Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

[float]
=== dns

Fields describing DNS queries and answers.
DNS events should either represent a single DNS query prior to getting answers (`dns.type:query`) or they should represent a full exchange and contain the query details as well as all of the answers that were provided for this query (`dns.type:answer`).


*`dns.answers`*::
+
--
An array containing an object for each answer section returned by the server.
The main keys that should be present in these objects are defined by ECS. Records that have more information may contain more keys than what ECS defines.
Not all DNS data sources give all details about DNS answers. At minimum, answer objects must contain the `data` key. If more information is available, map as much of it to ECS as possible, and add any additional fields to the answer objects as custom fields.

type: object

--

*`dns.answers.class`*::
+
--
The class of DNS data contained in this resource record.

type: keyword

example: IN

--

*`dns.answers.data`*::
+
--
The data describing the resource.
The meaning of this data depends on the type and class of the resource record.

type: keyword

example: 10.10.10.10

--

*`dns.answers.name`*::
+
--
The domain name to which this resource record pertains.
If a chain of CNAME is being resolved, each answer's `name` should be the one that corresponds with the answer's `data`. It should not simply be the original `question.name` repeated.

type: keyword

example: www.example.com

--

*`dns.answers.ttl`*::
+
--
The time interval in seconds that this resource record may be cached before it should be discarded. Zero values mean that the data should not be cached.

type: long

example: 180

--

*`dns.answers.type`*::
+
--
The type of data contained in this resource record.

type: keyword

example: CNAME

--

*`dns.header_flags`*::
+
--
Array of 2 letter DNS header flags.
Expected values are: AA, TC, RD, RA, AD, CD, DO.

type: keyword

example: ["RD", "RA"]

--

*`dns.id`*::
+
--
The DNS packet identifier assigned by the program that generated the query. The identifier is copied to the response.

type: keyword

example: 62111

--

*`dns.op_code`*::
+
--
The DNS operation code that specifies the kind of query in the message. This value is set by the originator of a query and copied into the response.

type: keyword

example: QUERY

--

*`dns.question.class`*::
+
--
The class of records being queried.

type: keyword

example: IN

--

*`dns.question.name`*::
+
--
The name being queried.
If the name field contains non-printable characters (below 32 or above 126), those characters should be represented as escaped base 10 integers (\DDD). Back slashes and quotes should be escaped. Tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds should be converted to \t, \r, and \n respectively.

type: keyword

example: www.example.com

--

*`dns.question.registered_domain`*::
+
--
The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.
For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".
This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".

type: keyword

example: example.com

--

*`dns.question.subdomain`*::
+
--
The subdomain is all of the labels under the registered_domain.
If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.

type: keyword

example: www

--

*`dns.question.top_level_domain`*::
+
--
The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com".
This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".

type: keyword

example: co.uk

--

*`dns.question.type`*::
+
--
The type of record being queried.

type: keyword

example: AAAA

--

*`dns.resolved_ip`*::
+
--
Array containing all IPs seen in `answers.data`.
The `answers` array can be difficult to use, because of the variety of data formats it can contain. Extracting all IP addresses seen in there to `dns.resolved_ip` makes it possible to index them as IP addresses, and makes them easier to visualize and query for.

type: ip

example: ["10.10.10.10", "10.10.10.11"]

--

*`dns.response_code`*::
+
--
The DNS response code.

type: keyword

example: NOERROR

--

*`dns.type`*::
+
--
The type of DNS event captured, query or answer.
If your source of DNS events only gives you DNS queries, you should only create dns events of type `dns.type:query`.
If your source of DNS events gives you answers as well, you should create one event per query (optionally as soon as the query is seen). And a second event containing all query details as well as an array of answers.

type: keyword

example: answer

--

[float]
=== ecs

Meta-information specific to ECS.


*`ecs.version`*::
+
--
ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.

type: keyword

example: 1.0.0

required: True

--

[float]
=== error

These fields can represent errors of any kind.
Use them for errors that happen while fetching events or in cases where the event itself contains an error.


*`error.code`*::
+
--
Error code describing the error.

type: keyword

--

*`error.id`*::
+
--
Unique identifier for the error.

type: keyword

type: keyword

Field is not indexed.

--

*`error.stack_trace.text`*::
+
--
type: text

--

*`error.type`*::
+
--
The type of the error, for example the class name of the exception.

type: keyword

example: java.lang.NullPointerException

--

[float]
=== event

The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.
A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric and state events.


*`event.action`*::
+
--
The action captured by the event.
This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.

type: keyword

example: user-password-change

--

*`event.category`*::
+
--
This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.
This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories.

type: keyword

example: authentication

--

*`event.code`*::
+
--
Identification code for this event, if one exists.
Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID.

type: keyword

example: 4648

--

*`event.created`*::
+
--
event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.
This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event.
In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.
In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.

type: date

example: 2016-05-23T08:05:34.857Z

--

*`event.dataset`*::
+
--
Name of the dataset.
If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.
It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.

type: keyword

example: apache.access

--

*`event.duration`*::
+
--
Duration of the event in nanoseconds.
If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time.

type: long

format: duration

--

*`event.end`*::
+
--
event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed.

type: date

--

*`event.hash`*::
+
--
Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity.

type: keyword

example: 123456789012345678901234567890ABCD

--

*`event.id`*::
+
--
Unique ID to describe the event.

type: keyword

example: 8a4f500d

--

*`event.ingested`*::
+
--
Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.
This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event.
In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`.

type: date

example: 2016-05-23T08:05:35.101Z

--

*`event.kind`*::
+
--
This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.
The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not.

type: keyword

example: alert

--

*`event.module`*::
+
--
Name of the module this data is coming from.
If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module.

type: keyword

example: apache

--

*`event.original`*::
+
--
Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity.
This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, consider using the wildcard data type.

type: keyword

example: Sep 19 08:26:10 host CEF:0&#124;Security&#124; threatmanager&#124;1.0&#124;100&#124; worm successfully stopped&#124;10&#124;src=10.0.0.1 dst=2.1.2.2spt=1232

Field is not indexed.

--

*`event.outcome`*::
+
--
This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.

type: keyword

example: success

--

*`event.provider`*::
+
--
Source of the event.
Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing).

type: keyword

example: kernel

--

*`event.reason`*::
+
--
Reason why this event happened, according to the source.
This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`).

type: keyword

example: Terminated an unexpected process

--

*`event.reference`*::
+
--
Reference URL linking to additional information about this event.
This URL links to a static definition of this event. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field.

type: keyword

example: https://system.example.com/event/#0001234

--

*`event.risk_score`*::
+
--
Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions). Use your system's original value here.

type: float

--

*`event.risk_score_norm`*::
+
--
Normalized risk score or priority of the event, on a scale of 0 to 100.
This is mainly useful if you use more than one system that assigns risk scores, and you want to see a normalized value across all systems.

type: float

--

*`event.sequence`*::
+
--
Sequence number of the event.
The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision.

type: long

format: string

--

*`event.severity`*::
+
--
The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.
What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source.
The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`.

type: long

example: 7

format: string

--

*`event.start`*::
+
--
event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed.

type: date

--

*`event.timezone`*::
+
--
This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise.
Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00").

type: keyword

--

*`event.type`*::
+
--
This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.
This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types.

type: keyword

--

*`event.url`*::
+
--
URL linking to an external system to continue investigation of this event.
This URL links to another system where in-depth investigation of the specific occurrence of this event can take place. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field.

type: keyword

example: https://mysystem.example.com/alert/5271dedb-f5b0-4218-87f0-4ac4870a38fe

--

[float]
=== file

A file is defined as a set of information that has been created on, or has existed on a filesystem.
File objects can be associated with host events, network events, and/or file events (e.g., those produced by File Integrity Monitoring [FIM] products or services). File fields provide details about the affected file associated with the event or metric.

+
--
Last time the file was accessed.
Note that not all filesystems keep track of access time.

type: date

+
--
Device that is the source of the file.

type: keyword

example: sda

--

*`file.directory`*::

=== related

This field set is meant to facilitate pivoting around a piece of data.
Some pieces of information can be seen in many places in an ECS event. To facilitate searching for them, store an array of all seen values to their corresponding field in `related.`.
A concrete example is IP addresses, which can be under host, observer, source, destination, client, server, and network.forwarded_ip. If you append all IPs to `related.ip`, you can then search for a given IP trivially, no matter where it appeared, by querying `related.ip:192.0.2.15`.


*`related.hash`*::

[float]
=== server

A Server is defined as the responder in a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.
For TCP events, the server is the receiver of the initial SYN packet(s) of the TCP connection. For other protocols, the server is generally the responder in the network transaction. Some systems actually use the term "responder" to refer the server in TCP connections. The server fields describe details about the system acting as the server in the network event. Server fields are usually populated in conjunction with client fields. Server fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.
Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.


*`server.address`*::
+
--
Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

*`server.subdomain`*::
+
--
The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.

[float]
=== service

The service fields describe the service for or from which the data was collected.
These fields help you find and correlate logs for a specific service and version.


*`service.ephemeral_id`*::
+
--
Ephemeral identifier of this service (if one exists).
This id normally changes across restarts, but `service.id` does not.

type: keyword

example: 8a4f500f

--

*`service.id`*::
+
--
Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes.
This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event.
Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead.

type: keyword

example: d37e5ebfe0ae6c4972dbe9f0174a1637bb8247f6

--

*`service.name`*::
+
--
Name of the service data is collected from.
The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name.
In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified.

type: keyword

example: elasticsearch-metrics

--

*`service.node.name`*::
+
--
Name of a service node.
This allows for two nodes of the same service running on the same host to be differentiated. Therefore, `service.node.name` should typically be unique across nodes of a given service.
In the case of Elasticsearch, the `service.node.name` could contain the unique node name within the Elasticsearch cluster. In cases where the service doesn't have the concept of a node name, the host name or container name can be used to distinguish running instances that make up this service. If those do not provide uniqueness (e.g. multiple instances of the service running on the same host) - the node name can be manually set.

type: keyword

example: instance-0000000016

--

*`service.state`*::
+
--
Current state of the service.

type: keyword

--

*`service.type`*::
+
--
The type of the service data is collected from.
The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type.
Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`.

type: keyword

example: elasticsearch

--

*`service.version`*::
+
--
Version of the service the data was collected from.
This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service.

type: keyword

example: 3.2.4

--

[float]
=== source

Source fields capture details about the sender of a network exchange/packet. These fields are populated from a network event, packet, or other event containing details of a network transaction.
Source fields are usually populated in conjunction with destination fields. The source and destination fields are considered the baseline and should always be filled if an event contains source and destination details from a network transaction. If the event also contains identification of the client and server roles, then the client and server fields should also be populated.


*`source.address`*::
+
--
Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

*`source.registered_domain`*::
+
--
The highest registered source domain, stripped of the subdomain.
For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".
This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
