[[unable-to-deploy]]
=== Deployment to AWS fails with "failed to create the stack"

Deployment fails if you attempt to deploy the Lambda function to the wrong
region.

You must deploy the function to the region where your services are running. For
example, if you want to monitor CloudWatch logs for a service running in the
`us-east-1` region, you must deploy the Lambda function to the same region, or
deployment fails.
