== Filter and enhance the exported data

Your use case might require only a subset of the data exported by {beatname_uc},
or you might need to enhance the exported data (for example, by adding
metadata). {beatname_uc} provides a couple of options for filtering and
enhancing exported data.

You can specify a <<{beatname_lc}-filter_pattern,`filter_pattern`>> to match the
data you want to send. This approach may reduce execution costs because the
function running {beatname_uc} only executes if there is data that matches the
pattern.

Another approach (the one described here) is to define processors.
