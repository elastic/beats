The Beat processor (`beat`) is an OpenTelemetry Collector processor that wraps the [Beat processors].
This allows you to use Beat processorss like e.g. [add_host_metadata] anywhere in the OpenTelemetry Collector's pipeline, independently of Beat receivers.

> [!NOTE]
> This component is only expected to work correctly with data from the Beat receivers: [Filebeat receiver], [Metricbeat receiver].
> This is because it relies on the specific structure of telemetry emitted by those components.
> Using it with data coming from other components is not recommended and may result in unexpected behavior.

## Example

The following [Filebeat receiver] configuration

```yaml
receivers:
  filebeatreceiver:
    filebeat:
      inputs:
        - type: filestream
          id: host-logs
          paths:
            - /var/log/*.log
    processors:
      - add_host_metadata: ~
    output:
      otelconsumer:
```

is functionally equivalent to this one, using the Beat processor:

```yaml
receivers:
  filebeatreceiver:
    filebeat:
      inputs:
        - type: filestream
          id: host-logs
          paths:
            - /var/log/*.log
    output:
      otelconsumer:

processors:
  beat:
    processors:
      - add_host_metadata: ~
```
