== Security Module

beta[]

The security module processes event log records from the Security log.

The module has transformations for the following event IDs:

* 4624 - An account was successfully logged on.
* 4625 - An account failed to log on.
* 4634 - An account was logged off.
* 4647 - User initiated logoff (interactive logon types).
* 4648 - A logon was attempted using explicit credentials.
* 4672 - Special privileges assigned to new logon.

More event IDs will be added.
