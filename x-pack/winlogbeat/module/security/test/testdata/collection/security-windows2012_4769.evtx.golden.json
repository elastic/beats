The service name indicates the resource to which access was requested.\n\nThis event can be correlated with Windows logon events by comparing the Logon GUID fields in each event.  The logon event occurs on the machine that was accessed, which is often a different machine than the domain controller which issued the service ticket.\n\nTicket options, encryption types, and failure codes are defined in RFC 4120.",
