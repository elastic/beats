== Sysmon Module

beta[]

The sysmon module processes event log records from the
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon[Sysinternals
System Monitor] (Sysmon) which is a Windows service and device driver that logs
system activity to the event log. Sysmon is not bundled with Windows or
Winlogbeat and must be installed independently.

The default configuration file includes configuration for Sysmon. If you do not
have Sysmon installed Winlogbeat will log a warning that it could not read from
the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` channel. It will continue to read
from the other configured channels. If you do install Sysmon at a later time
then a restart of Winlogbeat is required to make it begin reading from the
channel.

This module was built based on Sysmon v9 event manifests. It contains
transformations for each of the defined event IDs.
