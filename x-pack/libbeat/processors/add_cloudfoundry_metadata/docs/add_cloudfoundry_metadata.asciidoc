=== Add Cloud Foundry metadata

experimental[]

The `add_cloudfoundry_metadata` processor annotates each event with relevant metadata
from Cloud Foundry applications. The events are annotated with Cloud Foundry metadata,
only if the event contains a reference to a Cloud Foundry application (using field
`cloudfoundry.app.id`) and the configured Cloud Foundry client is able to retrieve
information for the application.

Each event is annotated with:

* Application Name
* Space ID
* Space Name
* Organization ID
* Organization Name
