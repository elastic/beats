This directory is pinned to allow placement of the Npcap OEM installer
during x-pack Packetbeat builds.

Only one exe file may be placed here and this should be the most recent
available Npcap installer. As part of the distribution a place-holder file
is put here to allow compilation. This file must be removed when a real
installer in included for the build.
