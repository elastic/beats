This directory is pinned to allow placement of the Npcap OEM installer
during x-pack Packetbeat builds.

Only one additional exe file may be placed here beyond the place-holder
and this should be the most recent available Npcap installer. As part of the
distribution a place-holder file is put here to allow compilation.
