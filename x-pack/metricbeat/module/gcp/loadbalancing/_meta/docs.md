Load Balancing metricset fetches metrics from [Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/) in Google Cloud Platform.

The `loadbalancing` metricset contains all metrics exported from the [Stackdriver API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-loadbalancing). The field names are aligned to [Beats naming conventions](/extend/event-conventions.md) with minor modifications to their GCP metrics name counterpart.
