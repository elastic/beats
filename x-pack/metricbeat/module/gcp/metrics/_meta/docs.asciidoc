Operations monitoring provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health
of cloud-powered applications. It collects metrics, events, and metadata from
different services from Google Cloud. This metricset is to collect monitoring
metrics from Google Cloud using `ListTimeSeries` API. The full list of metric
types that Google Cloud monitoring supports can be found in
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp[Google Cloud Metrics].

Each monitoring metric from Google Cloud has a sample period and/or ingest delay.
Sample period is the time interval between consecutive data points for metrics
that are written periodically. Ingest delay represents the time for data points
older than this value are guaranteed to be available to read. Sample period and
ingest delay are obtained from making
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors/list[ListMetricDescriptors API]
call.

== Metricset config and parameters

* *aligner*: A single string with which aggregation operation need to be applied
onto time series data for ListTimeSeries API. If it's not given, default aligner
is `ALIGN_NONE`. Google Cloud also supports `ALIGN_DELTA`, `ALIGN_RATE`,
`ALIGN_MIN`, `ALIGN_MAX`, `ALIGN_MEAN`, `ALIGN_COUNT`, `ALIGN_SUM` etc.
Please see
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rpc/google.monitoring.v3#aligner[Aggregation Aligner]
for the full list of aligners.

* *metric_types*: Required, a list of metric type strings, or a list of metric
type prefixes. For example, `instance/cpu` is the prefix for metric type
`instance/cpu/usage_time`, `instance/cpu/utilization` etc Each call of the
`ListTimeSeries` API can return any number of time series from a single metric
type. Metric type is to used for identifying a specific time series.

* *service*: Required, the name of the service for related metrics. This should
be a valid Google Cloud service name. Service names may be viewed from the
corresponding page from https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics[GCP Metrics list documentation].
The `service` field is used to compute the GCP Metric prefix, unless
`service_metric_prefix` is set.

* *service_metric_prefix*: A string containing the full Metric prefix as
specified in the GCP documentation.
All metrics from GCP Monitoring API require a prefix. When
`service_metric_prefix` is empty, the prefix default to a value computed using
the `service` value: `<service>.googleapis.com/`. This default works for any
services under "Google Cloud metrics", but does not work for other services
(`kubernetes` aka GKE for example).
This option allow to override the default and specify an arbitrary metric prefix.

=== Example Configuration
* `metrics` metricset is enabled to collect metrics from all zones under
`europe-west1-c` region in `elastic-observability` project. Two sets of metrics
are specified: first one is to collect CPU usage time and utilization with
aggregation aligner ALIGN_MEAN; second one is to collect uptime with aggregation
aligner ALIGN_SUM. These metric types all have 240 seconds ingest delay time and
60 seconds sample period. With `period` specified as `300s` in the config below,
Metricbeat will collect compute metrics from Google Cloud every 5-minute with
given aggregation aligner applied for each metric type.

* `metrics` metricset is enabled to collect metrics from all zones under
`europe-west1-c` region in `elastic-observability` project. Two sets of metrics
are specified: first one is to collect CPU usage time and utilization with
aggregation aligner ALIGN_MEAN; second one is to collect uptime with aggregation

Metricbeat will collect compute metrics from Google Cloud every minute with no
aggregation. This case, the aligners specified in the configuration will be
ignored.

* `metrics` metricset is enabled to collect metrics from all zones under
`europe-west1-c` region in `elastic-observability` project. One set of metrics
will be collected: core usage time for containers in GCP GKE.
Note that the is required to use `service_metric_prefix` to override the default
metric prefix, as for GKE metrics the required prefix is `kubernetes.io/`
