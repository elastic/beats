`gke` metricset is designed for collecting metrics from https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine[Google Kubernetes
Engine].
Google Cloud Monitoring supports Google Kubernetes Engine metrics, as listed in
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_kubernetes[Google Cloud Monitoring Kubernetes metrics].

This metricset collects all GA Kubernetes metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring
APIs. It leverages under the hood the `metrics` metricset.

We recommend users to define `period: 1m` for this metricset because in Google
Cloud, GKE monitoring metrics are sampled every 60 seconds.
Some of the metrics have an ingest delay up to 240 seconds.
