PubSub metricsetf fetches metrics from https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/[Pub/Sub] topics and subscriptions in Google Cloud Platform.

The `pubsub` metricset contains all GA stage metrics exported from the https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-pubsub[Stackdriver API]. The field names are aligned to {beats-devguide}/event-conventions.html[Beats naming conventions] with minor modifications to their GCP metrics name counterpart.

No special permissions are needed apart from the ones detailed in the module section of the docs.
