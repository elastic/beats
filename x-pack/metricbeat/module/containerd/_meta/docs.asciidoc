:modulename!:

Containerd module collects cpu, memory and blkio statistics about
running containers controlled by containerd runtime.

The current metricsets are: `cpu`, `blkio` and `memory` and are enabled by default.

[float]
=== Prerequisites
`Containerd` daemon has to be configured to provide metrics before enabling containerd module.

In the configuration file located in `/etc/containerd/config.toml` metrics endpoint needs to
be set and containerd daemon needs to be restarted.

```
[metrics]
    address = "127.0.0.1:1338"
```

[float]
=== Compatibility

The Containerd module is tested with the following versions of Containerd:
v1.5.2

[float]
=== Module-specific configuration notes

For cpu metricset if `calcpct.cpu` setting is set to true, cpu usage percentages will be calculated
and more specifically fields `containerd.cpu.usage.total.pct`, `containerd.cpu.usage.kernel.pct`, `containerd.cpu.usage.user.pct`.
Default value is true.

For memory metricset if `calcpct.memory` setting is set to true, memory usage percentages will be calculated
and more specifically fields `containerd.memory.usage.pct` and  `containerd.memory.workingset.pct`.
Default value is true.
