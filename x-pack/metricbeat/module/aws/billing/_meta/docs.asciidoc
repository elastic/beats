You can monitor your estimated AWS charges by using Amazon CloudWatch. When you
enable the monitoring of estimated charges for your AWS account, the estimated
charges are calculated and sent several times daily to CloudWatch as metric data.

Billing metric data is stored in the US East (N. Virginia) Region and represents
worldwide charges. This data includes the estimated charges for every service in
AWS that you use, in addition to the estimated overall total of your AWS charges.

This aws `billing` metricset collects these Cloudwatch metrics for monitoring
purposes.
