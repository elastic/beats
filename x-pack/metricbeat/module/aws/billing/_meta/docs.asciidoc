=== Metricset-specific configuration notes
When querying AWS Cost Explorer API, you can group AWS costs using up to two
different groups, either dimensions, tag keys, or both. Right now we support
group by type dimension and type tag with separate config parameters:

* *group_by_dimension_keys*: A list of keys used in Cost Explorer to group by
dimensions. Valid values are AZ, INSTANCE_TYPE, LINKED_ACCOUNT, OPERATION, PURCHASE_TYPE, REGION, SERVICE, USAGE_TYPE, USAGE_TYPE_GROUP, RECORD_TYPE, OPERATING_SYSTEM, TENANCY, SCOPE, PLATFORM, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME, DEPLOYMENT_OPTION, DATABASE_ENGINE, CACHE_ENGINE, INSTANCE_TYPE_FAMILY, BILLING_ENTITY and RESERVATION_ID.

* *group_by_tag_keys*: A list of keys used in Cost Explorer to group by tags.
