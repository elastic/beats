The `dynamodb` metricset of aws module allows you to monitor your AWS DynamoDB database. `dynamodb` metricset fetches a set of values from [Amazon DynamoDB Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html). For all other DynamoDB metrics, the aggregation granularity is five minutes.


## Configuration example [_configuration_example_3]

```yaml
- module: aws
  period: 300s
  metricsets:
    - dynamodb
  # This module uses the aws cloudwatch metricset, all
  # the options for this metricset are also available here.
```


## Dashboard [_dashboard_4]

The aws dynamodb metricset comes with a predefined dashboard. For example:
