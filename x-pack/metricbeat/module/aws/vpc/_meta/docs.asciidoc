The vpc metricset of aws module allows users to monitor VPC related services: NAT
gateway, transit gateway and VPN tunnels.
NAT gateway metric data can be used to monitor and troubleshoot NAT gateways and
the data is provided at 1-minute intervals to CloudWatch.
Transit gateway metrics are sent to CloudWatch by VPC only when requests are
flowing through the gateway. If there are requests flowing through the transit
gateway, Amazon VPC measures and sends its metrics in 1-minute intervals.
VPN metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch as it becomes available. Users
can use these metrics to gain a better perspective on how the web application or
service is performing.
