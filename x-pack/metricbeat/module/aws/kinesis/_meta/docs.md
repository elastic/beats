Amazon Kinesis Data Streams sends data points to CloudWatch for monitoring purpose, such as to track shard usage, monitor incoming bytes and outgoing bytes. These metrics are automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch every minute. There are two different levels of monitoring metrics:

* **Basic(stream-level)**: Stream-level data is sent automatically every minute at no charge.
* **Enhanced(shard-level)**: Shard-level data is sent every minute for an additional cost. To get this level of data, you must specifically enable it for the stream using the [EnableEnhancedMonitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_EnableEnhancedMonitoring.html) operation.


## AWS Permissions [_aws_permissions_7]

Some specific AWS permissions are required for IAM user to collect AWS EBS metrics.

```

## Dashboard [_dashboard_8]

The kinesis metricset comes with a predefined dashboard. For example:
