        - name: GetRecords.Bytes.avg
          type: double
          description: >
            The average number of bytes retrieved from the Kinesis stream, measured over the specified time period.
        - name: GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds.avg
          type: double
          description: >
            The age of the last record in all GetRecords calls made against a Kinesis stream, measured over the specified time period.
            Age is the difference between the current time and when the last record of the GetRecords call was written to the stream.

          type: double
          description: >
            The time taken per GetRecords operation, measured over the specified time period.
        - name: GetRecords.Records.sum
          type: long
          description: >
            The number of records retrieved from the shard, measured over the specified time period.
        - name: GetRecords.Success.sum
          type: long
          description: >
            The number of successful GetRecords operations per stream, measured over the specified time period.
        - name: IncomingBytes.avg
          type: double
          description: >
            The number of bytes successfully put to the Kinesis stream over the specified time period. This metric includes bytes from PutRecord and PutRecords operations.
        - name: IncomingRecords.avg
          type: double
          description: >
            The number of records successfully put to the Kinesis stream over the specified time period. This metric includes record counts from PutRecord and PutRecords operations.
        - name: PutRecord.Bytes.avg
          type: double
          description: >
            The number of bytes put to the Kinesis stream using the PutRecord operation over the specified time period.
        - name: PutRecord.Latency.avg
          type: double
          description: >
            The time taken per PutRecord operation, measured over the specified time period.
