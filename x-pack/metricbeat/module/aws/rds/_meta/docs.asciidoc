The rds metricset of aws module allows you to monitor your AWS RDS service. `rds` metricset fetches a set of metrics from
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MonitoringOverview.html[Amazon RDS] and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Monitoring.html[Amazon Aurora DB].
with Amazon RDS, users can monitor network throughput, I/O for read, write, and/or
metadata operations, client connections, and burst credit balances for their DB instances.
Amazon RDS sends metrics and dimensions to Amazon CloudWatch every minute.
Amazon Aurora provides a variety of Amazon CloudWatch metrics that users can
use to monitor health and performance of their Aurora DB cluster. This metricset
by default collects all tags from AWS RDS.
