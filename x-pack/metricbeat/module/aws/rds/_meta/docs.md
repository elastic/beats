The rds metricset of aws module allows you to monitor your AWS RDS service. `rds` metricset fetches a set of metrics from [Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MonitoringOverview.html) and [Amazon Aurora DB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Monitoring.html). with Amazon RDS, users can monitor network throughput, I/O for read, write, and/or metadata operations, client connections, and burst credit balances for their DB instances. Amazon RDS sends metrics and dimensions to Amazon CloudWatch every minute. Amazon Aurora provides a variety of Amazon CloudWatch metrics that users can use to monitor health and performance of their Aurora DB cluster. This metricset by default collects all tags from AWS RDS.
