The ec2 metricset of aws module allows you to monitor your AWS EC2 instances,
including `cpu`, `network`, `disk` and `status`. `ec2` metricset fetches a set of values from
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html#ec2-cloudwatch-metrics[Cloudwatch AWS EC2 Metrics].

We fetch the following data:

* *cpu.total.pct*: The percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that are currently in use on the instance.
* *cpu.credit_usage*: The number of CPU credits spent by the instance for CPU utilization.
* *cpu.credit_balance*: The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued since it was launched or started.
* *cpu.surplus_credit_balance*: The number of surplus credits that have been spent by an unlimited instance when its CPUCreditBalance value is zero.
* *cpu.surplus_credits_charged*: The number of spent surplus credits that are not paid down by earned CPU credits, and which thus incur an additional charge.
* *network.in.packets*: The number of packets received on all network interfaces by the instance.
* *network.out.packets*: The number of packets sent out on all network interfaces by the instance.
* *network.in.bytes*: The number of bytes received on all network interfaces by the instance.
* *network.out.bytes*: The number of bytes sent out on all network interfaces by the instance.
* *diskio.read.bytes*: Bytes read from all instance store volumes available to the instance.
* *diskio.write.bytes*: Bytes written to all instance store volumes available to the instance.
* *diskio.read.ops*: Completed read operations from all instance store volumes available to the instance in a specified period of time.
* *diskio.write.ops*: Completed write operations to all instance store volumes available to the instance in a specified period of time.
* *status.check_failed*: Reports whether the instance has passed both the instance status check and the system status check in the last minute.
* *status.check_failed_system*: Reports whether the instance has passed the system status check in the last minute.
* *status.check_failed_instance*: Reports whether the instance has passed the instance status check in the last minute.
* *instance.core.count*: The number of CPU cores for the instance.
* *instance.image.id*: The ID of the image used to launch the instance.
* *instance.monitoring.state*: Indicates whether detailed monitoring is enabled.
* *instance.private.dns_name*: The private DNS name of the network interface.
* *instance.private.ip*: The private IPv4 address associated with the network interface.
* *instance.public.dns_name*: The public DNS name of the instance.
* *instance.public.ip*: The address of the Elastic IP address (IPv4) bound to the network interface.
* *instance.state.code*: The state of the instance, as a 16-bit unsigned integer.
* *instance.threads_per_core*: The state of the instance (pending | running | shutting-down | terminated | stopping | stopped).
