The `statsd` module is a Metricbeat module which spawns a UDP server and listens for metrics in StatsD compatible
format.

=== Metric types

The module supports the following types of metrics:

*Counter (c)*:: Measurement which accumulates over period of time until flushed (value set to 0).

*Gauge (g)*:: Measurement which can increase, decrease or be set to a value.

*Timer (ms)*:: Time measurement (in milliseconds) of an event.

*Histogram (h)*:: Time measurement, alias for timer.

*Set (s)*:: Measurement which counts unique occurrences until flushed (value set to 0).

=== Module-specific configuration notes

The `statsd` module has these additional config options:

*`ttl`*:: It defines how long a metric will be reported after it was last recorded.
Irrespective of the given ttl, metrics will be reported at least once.
A ttl of zero means metrics will never expire.

=== Metricsets

Currently, there is only `server` metricset in `statsd` module.

==== `server`
The metricset collects metric data sent using UDP and publishes them under the `statsd` prefix.
