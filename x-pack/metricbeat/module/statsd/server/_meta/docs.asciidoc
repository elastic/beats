This is the server metricset of the module stats.

Events sent to the stats endpoint will be put by default under the `statsd` prefix.

_ttl_ defines how long a metric will be reported after it was last recorded.
Irrespective of the given ttl, metrics will be reported at least once.
A ttl of zero means metrics will never expire.
