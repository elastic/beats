`tablespace` Metricset includes information about data files and temp files, grouped by Tablespace with free space available, used space, status of the data files, status of the Tablespace, etc. The total set of fields available on the Metricset and their description are the following:

* *data_file.id*: Tablespace data file unique identifier number. Each data file of a Tablespace has a unique name (and each Tablespace may have more than one data file) but this is not the Tablespace ID.
* *data_file.name*: Filename of the data file (with the full path)
* *data_file.online_status*: Last known online status of the data file. One of SYSOFF, SYSTEM, OFFLINE, ONLINE or RECOVER.
* *data_file.size.bytes*: Size of the file in bytes.
* *data_file.size.free.bytes*: The size of the file available for user data. The actual size of the file minus this value is used to store file related metadata.
* *data_file.size.max.bytes*: Maximum file size in bytes
* *data_file.status*: File status: AVAILABLE or INVALID (INVALID means that the file number is not in use, for example, a file in a tablespace that was dropped)
* *name*: Tablespace name
* *space.free.bytes*: Tablespace total free space available, in bytes.
* *space.total.bytes*: Tablespace total size, in bytes. Calculated by adding the file sizes for each Tablespace.
* *space.used.bytes*: Tablespace used space, in bytes.
