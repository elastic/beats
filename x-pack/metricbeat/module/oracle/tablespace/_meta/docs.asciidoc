`tablespace` Metricset includes information about data files and temp files, grouped by Tablespace with free space available, used space, status of the data files, status of the Tablespace, etc.

[float]
=== Required database access

To ensure that the module has access to the appropriate metrics, the module requires that you configure a user with access to the following tables:

* SYS.DBA_TEMP_FILES
* DBA_TEMP_FREE_SPACE
* dba_data_files
* dba_free_space

[float]
=== Description of fields

* *data_file.id*: Tablespace data file unique identifier number. Each data file of a Tablespace has a unique name (and each Tablespace may have more than one data file) but this is not the Tablespace ID.
* *data_file.name*: Filename of the data file (with the full path)
* *data_file.online_status*: Last known online status of the data file. One of SYSOFF, SYSTEM, OFFLINE, ONLINE or RECOVER.
* *data_file.size.bytes*: Size of the file in bytes.
* *data_file.size.free.bytes*: The size of the file available for user data. The actual size of the file minus this value is used to store file related metadata.
* *data_file.size.max.bytes*: Maximum file size in bytes
* *data_file.status*: File status: AVAILABLE or INVALID (INVALID means that the file number is not in use, for example, a file in a tablespace that was dropped)
* *name*: Tablespace name
* *space.free.bytes*: Tablespace total free space available, in bytes.
* *space.total.bytes*: Tablespace total size, in bytes. Calculated by adding the file sizes for each Tablespace.
* *space.used.bytes*: Tablespace used space, in bytes.
