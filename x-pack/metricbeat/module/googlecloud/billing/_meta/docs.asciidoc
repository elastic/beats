`billing` metricset is designed for collecting billing metrics from Google Cloud
BigQuery. BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse. Cloud Billing
export to BigQuery enables you to export detailed Google Cloud billing data
(such as usage, cost estimates, and pricing data) automatically throughout the
day to a BigQuery dataset that you specify. Then you can access your Cloud
Billing data from BigQuery for detailed analysis using Metricbeat. Please see
https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery[export cloud
billing data to BigQuery] for more details on how to export billing data.
