This is the proxy metricset of the module istio.
This metricset collects metrics from the Envoy proxy's Prometheus exporter for Istio versions higher than 1.5

Tested with Istio 1.7

=== Deployment

Istio-proxy is a sidecar container that is being injected into every Pod that is
being deployed on a Kubernetes cluster which's traffic is managed by Istio.
Because of this reason, in oder to collect metrics from this sidecars we need
to automatically identify these sidecar containers and start monitoring them
using their IP and the predifined port (15090). This can be achieved easily by
defining the proper autodiscover provider that will automatically identifies
all these sidecar containers and will start `proxy` metricset for each one of
them. Here is an example configuration that can be used for that purpose:


["source", "yaml"]
--------------------------------------------
metricbeat.autodiscover:
  providers:
    - type: kubernetes
      node: ${NODE_NAME}
      templates:
        - condition:
            contains:
              kubernetes.annotations.prometheus.io/path: "/stats/prometheus"
          config:
            - module: istio
              metricsets: ["proxy"]
              hosts: "${data.host}:15090"
--------------------------------------------
