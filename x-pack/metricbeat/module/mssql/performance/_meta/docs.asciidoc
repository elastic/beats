`performance` Metricset fetches information from what's commonly known as https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-performance-counters-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017[Performance Counters] in MSSQL.

We fetch the following data:

* *Page splits per instance*: Cumulative per instance. Show diffs between periodic readings to identify periods of frequent page splits.
* *Buffer page life expectancy* in seconds: The expected time in seconds that a data page will remain in the buffer pool.
* *Lock wait time* in seconds: Cumulative per instance. Show diffs between periodic readings to identify periods of high lock contention.
* Total number of *user connections*.
* Total number of *transactions*.
* *Active temp tables*: Number of temporary tables/table variables in use.
* *Logins* per second: Total number of logins started per second. This does not include pooled connections.
* *Logouts* per second: Total number of logout operations started per second.
* *Connections reset*: Total number of logins started from the connection pool.
* Cumulative (per instance) *recompilations* time in seconds: Show diffs between periodic readings to identify periods of high SQL re-compilations.
* *Compilations* time in seconds: Cumulative per instance. Show diffs between periodic readings to identify periods of high SQL compilations.
* *Batch requests time* in seconds: Cumulative per instance. Show diffs between periodic readings to identify periods of high request activity.
* *Buffer Cache hit*: Percentage of data pages found in buffer cache without having to read from disk.
* *Checkpoint pages*: Indicates the number of pages flushed to disk per second by a checkpoint or other operation that require all dirty pages to be flushed.
* *Database pages*: Indicates the number of pages in the buffer pool with database content.
* *Target pages*: Ideal number of pages in the buffer pool.
