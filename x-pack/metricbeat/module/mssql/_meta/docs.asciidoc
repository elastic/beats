This is the https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017[Microsoft SQL 2017] Metricbeat module. It is still in beta and under active development to add new Metricsets and introduce enhancements.

The idea is to improve the current set of metrics by fetching data from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/system-dynamic-management-views?view=sql-server-2017[System Dynamic Management Views]. A curated dashboard will also be included soon.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sql-server-operating-system-related-dynamic-management-views-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017[Operating system, Performance] and  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/server-related-dynamic-management-views-and-functions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017[Server] Metricsets are under active development already.

== Compatibility

The module is being tested with https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux/[2017 GA] version under Linux. We'll also test it under various Windows versions to ensure correctness as soon as possible.

== Metricsets

The following Metricset is already included:

=== `db`

`db` Metricset fetches a set of values from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-log-space-usage-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017[log space usage] which returns space usage information for the transaction log for each different database.
