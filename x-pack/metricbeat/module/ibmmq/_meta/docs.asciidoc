This module periodically fetches metrics from a containerized distribution of IBM MQ.

=== Compatibility

The ibmmq `qmgr` metricset is compatible with a containerized distribution of IBM MQ (since version 9.1.0).
The Docker image starts the `runmqserver` process, which spawns the HTTP server exposing metrics in Prometheus
format ([source code](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-container/blob/9.1.0/internal/metrics/metrics.go)).

The Docker container lifecycle, including metrics collection, has been described in the [Internals](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-container/blob/9.1.0/docs/internals.md)
document.

The image provides an option to easily enable metrics exporter using an environment
variable:

`MQ_ENABLE_METRICS` - Set this to `true` to generate Prometheus metrics for the Queue Manager.
