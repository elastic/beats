This is the IBM MQ metricbeat module. This module uses PCF messages to collect metrics and status information from different IBM MQ objects.
With IBM MQ > v9 its also possible to collect data using the subscribe mode.

At the moment this is collecting data from Queue Manager.

=== Compability

This module is tested with IBM MQ v9.1.0 but older version will work as well. The subscribe mode only works with IBM MQ > v9.
