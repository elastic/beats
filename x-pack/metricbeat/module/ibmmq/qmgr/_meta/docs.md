This is the `qmgr` metricset of the IBM MQ module. It collects status information for the Queue Manager. The manager is a system program that is responsible for maintaining the queues and ensuring that the messages in the queues reach their destination.

This is a default metricset. If the host module is unconfigured, this metricset is enabled by default.
