# Elastic Agent developer docs

The source files for the general Elastic Agent documentation are currently stored
in the [observability-docs](https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs) repo. The following docs are only focused on getting developers started building code for Elastic Agent.

## Testing docker container

Running Elastic Agent in a docker container is a common use case. To build the Elastic Agent and create a docker image run the following command:

```
DEV=true SNAPSHOT=true PLATFORMS=linux/amd64 TYPES=docker mage package
```

If you are in the 7.13 branch, this will create the `docker.elastic.co/beats/elastic-agent:7.13.0-SNAPSHOT` image in your local environment. Now you can use this to for example test this container with the stack in elastic-package:

```
elastic-package stack up --version=7.13.0-SNAPSHOT -v
```
