# ================================ General =====================================
# Beats is configured under Fleet, you can define most settings
# from the Kibana UI. You can update this file to configure the settings that
# are not supported by Fleet.
management:
  mode: "fleet"

  # Check in frequency configure the time between calls to fleet to retrieve the new configuration.
  #
  # Default is 30s
  #checkin_frequency: 30s

  # Add variance between API calls to better distribute the calls.
  #jitter: 5s

  # The Elastic Agent does Exponential backoff when an error happen.
  #
  #backoff:
  #
  # Initial time to wait before retrying the call.
  # init: 1s
  #
  # Maximum time to wait before retrying the call.
  # max: 10s

# download:
#   # source of the artifacts, requires elastic like structure and naming of the binaries
#   # e.g /windows-x86.zip
#   sourceURI: "https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/"
#   # path to the directory containing downloaded packages
#   target_directory: "${path.data}/downloads"
#   # timeout for downloading package
#   timeout: 30s
#   # file path to a public key used for verifying downloaded artifacts
#   # if not file is present Elastic Agent will try to load public key from elastic.co website.
#   pgpfile: "${path.data}/elastic.pgp"
#   # install_path describes the location of installed packages/programs. It is also used
#   # for reading program specifications.
#   install_path: "${path.data}/install"

# process:
#   # minimal port number for spawned processes
#   min_port: 10000
#   # maximum port number for spawned processes
#   max_port: 30000
#   # timeout for creating new processes. when process is not successfully created by this timeout
#   # start operation is considered a failure
#   spawn_timeout: 30s

# retry:
#   # enabled determines whether retry is possible. Default is false.
#   enabled: true
#   # retries_count specifies number of retries. Default is 3.
#   # Retry count of 1 means it will be retried one time after one failure.
#   retries_count: 3
#   # delay specifies delay in ms between retries. Default is 30s
#   delay: 30s
#   # max_delay specifies maximum delay in ms between retries. Default is 300s
#   max_delay: 5m
#   # Exponential determines whether delay is treated as exponential.
#   # With 30s delay and 3 retries: 30, 60, 120s
#   # Default is false
#   exponential: false
