= Stop {agent}

To stop {agent} and its related executables, stop the {agent} process. Use the
commands that work for your system. 

//TODO: Replace with tabbed panel when it's out of experimental phase.

*Windows:*

If you installed the Agent as a service, stop the service. If
necessary, use Task Manager on Windows to stop {agent}. This will kill the
{agent} process and any sub-processes it created (such as {beats}).

*Linux or macOS:*

Run the following command to get the ID of the `elastic-agent` process:

[source,shell]
----
ps | grep elastic-agent
----

Then kill the process:

[source,shell]
----
kill -9 PID
----

Where `PID` is the ID of the `elastic-agent` process.

*Systemd:*

The DEB and RPM packages include a service unit for Linux systems with systemd.
On these systems, you can manage {agent} by using systemd commands. Use
`systemctl` to stop the Agent:

[source,shell]
----
systemctl stop elastic-agent
----
