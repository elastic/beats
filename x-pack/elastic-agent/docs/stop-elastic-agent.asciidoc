= Stop {agent}

To stop {agent} and its related executables, stop the {agent} process.

On Windows, if you installed the Agent as a service, stop the service. If
necessary, use Task Manager on Windows to stop {agent}. This will kill the
{agent} process and any sub-processes it created (such as {beats}).

On Linux or macOS, run the following command to get the ID of the
`elastic-agent` process:

[source,shell]
----
ps | grep elastic-agent
----

Then kill the process.
