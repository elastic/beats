= Upgrade {agent}

experimental[]

Starting with version 7.10, {fleet} provides upgrade capabilities. You can view
and select agents that are out of date, and trigger selected agents to download,
install, and run the new version.

This approach simplifies the process of keeping your agents up to date. It also
saves you time because you donâ€™t need third-party tools or processes to
manage upgrades.

NOTE: The upgrade feature is not supported for upgrading DEB/RPM packages or
Docker images. 

To upgrade {agent} to a new version:

. In {fleet}, select **Agents**.

. Under **Agents**, click **Upgrade available** to see a list of agents
that you can upgrade.

. To upgrade a single agent, choose **Upgrade agent** from the **Actions** menu
next to the agent you want to upgrade.
+
The **Upgrade agent** option is grayed out when an upgrade is unavailable, or
the {kib} version is lower than the agent version.

. To upgrade multiple agents, bulk select the agents and click
**Upgrade agents**.
