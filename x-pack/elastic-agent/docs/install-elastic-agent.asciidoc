== Manually install {agent} as a service on macOS

If you want {agent} to be persistent after restarts, you need to
install and run it as a service. Improved support for running {agent} as a
service on macOS will be available in a future release.

. Create a file called `co.elastic.agent.plist` in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`
and copy the following settings into the new file:
+
[source,text]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>co.elastic.agent</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Library/Elastic/Agent/elastic-agent</string>
        <string>run</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Library/Elastic/Agent</string>
    <key>UserName</key>
    <string>root</string>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>ThrottleInterval</key>
    <integer>15</integer>
    <key>EnableTransactions</key>
    <false/>
    <key>ExitTimeOut</key>
    <integer>60</integer>
</dict>
</plist>
----

. Change the ownership of the `.plist` file to `root`:
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/co.elastic.agent.plist
----

. Create the path `/Library/Elastic/Agent/`.

. Copy the files that you extracted from
+elastic-agent-{version}-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz+ into
`/Library/Elastic/Agent/`. 

. Start the agent as a service:
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/co.elastic.agent.plist
----
+
This command starts the agent, so do not attempt to use the `run` command.

*To stop and remove the service:*

. Stop the service and remove the property list file: 
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/Launchdaemons/co.elastic.agent.plist
rm /Library/Launchdaemons/co.elastic.agent.plist
----

. <<unenroll-elastic-agent,Unenroll the agent from {fleet}>>.
+
Unenrolling the agent should stop {agent} and any other programs started by
the agent, such as Elastic {endpoint-sec} and data shippers.

. If necessary, manually kill the `elastic-agent` process and any other
processes started by the agent.
