== How to bypass signature validation of artifacts

Elastic Agent verifies signature of packages on install. If there is a need to test unmerged features where signed binary does not exist custom Elastic Agent build is needed.

When Elastic Agent is built with `DEV=true` environment variable, it will not check any signatures allowing user to replace archive in agents `downloads` directory (usally `data/elastic-agent-{commit}/downloads`).

Using following command will result in an Elatic Agent archive with artifact security disabled.

```
cd x-pack/elastic-agent
DEV=true mage package
```

Resulting packages will be located in `x-pack/elastic-agent/build/distributions` directory.
