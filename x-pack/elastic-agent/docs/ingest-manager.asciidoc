= Ingest Manager

The Elastic Agent can operates in two different execution modes which are _standalone_ or _managed_.
The standalone mode allow you to manually configure your ingestion and send the data to Elasticsearch.
But to experience our complete vision for data ingestion you try to the _managed_ mode with the Ingest Manager.

This offer multiples advantages:

* A central place to configure and monitor your beats.
* An overview of the data ingest in your Elasticsearch cluster.
* Multiples integrations to collect and transform data.

Consult our {Ingest Manager} getting started guide.
