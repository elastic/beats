= Unenroll {agent}

You can unenroll an agent to invalidate the API key used to connect to {es}.

. In {fleet}, select **Agents**.

. Under Agents, choose **Unenroll agent** from the **Actions** menu next to the
agent you want to unenroll.

. Click **Unenroll agent**.

The agent will continue to run, but will not be able to send data. It will show
this error instead: `invalid api key to authenticate with fleet`.

TIP: If unenrollment hangs, select **Force unenroll** to invalidate all API
keys related to the agent and change the status to `inactive` so that the agent
no longer appears in {fleet}.
