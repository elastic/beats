= Run {agent}

experimental[]

{agent} runs in two modes: standalone or fleet. The two modes differ in how you
configure and manage the Agent.

[float]
[[fleet-mode]]
== Run in {fleet} mode

With _fleet mode_, you manage {agent} remotely. The Agent uses a trusted {kib}
instance to retrieve configurations and report Agent events. This trusted {kib}
instance must have {ingest-manager} and {fleet} enabled.

To create a trusted communication channel between {agent} and {kib}, enroll the
Agent to {fleet}.

To enroll an {agent} to {fleet}:

. Stop the Agent, if it's already running.

. Go the **{fleet}** tab in {ingest-manager}, and click **Enroll new agent** to
generate a token. See <<ingest-management-getting-started>> for detailed steps.

. Enroll the Agent:
+
[source,shell]
----
./elastic-agent enroll http://localhost:5601 $token
----
+
Where `$token` is an enrollment token acquired from {fleet}.

To start {agent}, run:
[source,shell]
----
./elastic-agent run
----

[float]
[[standalone-mode]]
== Run in standalone mode (default)

With _standalone mode_, you manually configure and manage the Agent locally.
Each Agent is configured to be in standalone mode by default after installation.

If {agent} is installed as an auto-starting service, it will run automatically
when you restart your system.

To start {agent} manually, run:

[source,shell]
----
./elastic-agent run
----

If no configuration file is specified, {agent} uses the default configuration,
`elastic-agent.yml`, which is located in the same directory as {agent}. Specify
the `-c` flag to use a different configuration file.

For configuration options, see <<elastic-agent-configuration>>.
