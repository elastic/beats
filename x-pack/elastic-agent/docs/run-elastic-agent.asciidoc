beta[]

{agent} runs in two modes: standalone or fleet. The two modes differ in how you
configure and manage the agent.

[discrete]
[[fleet-mode]]
== Run in {fleet} mode

With _fleet mode_, you manage {agent} remotely. The agent uses a trusted {kib}
instance to retrieve configurations and report agent events. This trusted {kib}
instance must have {ingest-manager} and {fleet} enabled.

To create a trusted communication channel between {agent} and {kib}, enroll the
agent to {fleet}.

To enroll an {agent} to {fleet}:

. Stop {agent}, if it's already running.

. In {ingest-manager}, click **Settings** and change the defaults, if necessary.
For self-managed installations, set the URLs for {es} and {kib}, including
the http ports, then save your changes.

. Select **{fleet}**, then click **Add agent** to get an enrollment token. See
<<ingest-management-getting-started>> for detailed steps.

. Change to the directory where {agent} is installed, and enroll the agent to
{fleet}:

[[standalone-mode]]
== Run in standalone mode (default)

With _standalone mode_, you manually configure and manage {agent} locally on the
system where the agent is installed. {agent} is configured to run in standalone
mode by default unless you enroll it in {fleet}. 

If {agent} is installed as an auto-starting service, it will run automatically
when you restart your system.

To start {agent} manually, run:

include::{beats-repo-dir}/x-pack/elastic-agent/docs/tab-widgets/run-standalone-widget.asciidoc[]

Use the `-c` flag to specify the configuration file. If no configuration file is
specified, {agent} uses the default configuration, `elastic-agent.yml`, which is
located in the same directory as {agent}.

For configuration options, see <<elastic-agent-configuration>>.
