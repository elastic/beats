= Manage your {agent}s

experimental[]

{agent} is a single, unified agent that you can deploy to hosts or containers to
collect data and send it to the {stack}. Behind the scenes, {agent} runs the
{beats} shippers or Endpoint required for your configuration.

//REVIEWERS: Maybe we shouldn't mention Endpoint yet ^^. WDYT?

//REVIEWERS: Moved this up because I think it's important to highlight this up
//front. It's covered in more detail later.

To learn how to install, configure, and run your {agent}s, see:

* <<elastic-agent-installation>>
* <<run-elastic-agent>>
* <<elastic-agent-cmd-options>>
* <<elastic-agent-configuration>>

//TODO: More these to the index.asciidoc for Ingest Management Guide?
