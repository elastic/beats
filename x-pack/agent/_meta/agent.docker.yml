management:
  # Mode of management, the agent support two modes of operation:
  #
  # local: The agent will expect to find the inputs configuration in the local file.
  #
  # Default is local.
  mode: "local"

  reporting:
    log:
      # format in which logs will be written, options are json or default.
      format: "default"

  # Allow the agent to reload his configuration locally on disk.
  # Notes: Only specific process configuration will be reloaded.
  reload:
    # enabled configure the agent to reload or not the local configuration.
    #
    # Default is true
    enabled: true

    # period define how frequent we should look for changes in the configuration.
    period: 10s

download:
  # source of the artifacts, requires elastic like structure and naming of the binaries

  # timeout for downloading package
  timeout: 30s
  # file path to a public key used for verifying downloaded artifacts
  # if not file is present agent will try to load public key from elastic.co website.

retry:
  # enabled determines whether retry is possible. Default is false.

  # Default is false
  exponential: false

  # enabled turns on monitoring of running processes
