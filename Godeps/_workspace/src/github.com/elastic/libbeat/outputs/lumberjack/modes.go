// loadBalancerMode balances the sending of events between multiple connections.

// The balancing algorithm is mostly pull-based, with multiple workers trying to pull
// some amount of work from a shared queue. Workers will try to get a new work item
// only if they have a working/active connection. Workers without active connection
// do not participate until a connection has been re-established.
// Due to the pull based nature the algorithm will load-balance events by random
// with workers having less latencies/turn-around times potentially getting more
// work items then other workers with higher latencies. Thusly the algorithm
// dynamically adapts to resource availability of server events are forwarded to.
//
// Workers not participating in the load-balancing will continuously try to reconnect
// to their configured endpoints. Once a new connection has been established,
// these workers will participate in in load-balancing again.
//
// If a connection becomes unavailable, the events are rescheduled for another
// connection to pick up. Rescheduling events is limited to a maximum number of
// send attempts. If events have not been send after maximum number of allowed
// attemps has been passed, they will be dropped.

// Distributing events to workers is subject to timeout. If no worker is available to
// pickup a message for sending, the message will be dropped internally.
