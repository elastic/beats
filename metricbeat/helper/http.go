package helper

/*

The http helper should make it simpler to implement any metrics which can be retrieved through http.

TODO:
 * Provide objects to support config for tls, username and headers for a http request
 * Support for get, post, put, delete, ...
 * Add interface HttpMetricer that could be checked automatically?
