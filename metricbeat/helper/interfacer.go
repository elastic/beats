= MetricSeter

== Timeout
Each metricseter must implement on his side to make sure the timeout is followed.
Otherwise it can lead to the issue that multiple calls for one metricset happen in parallel and pile up.

/*

Implementation Background of Fetch

The initial idea was to use a Cancel function, but it was not implemented as it would add complexity by requiring
an identifier for each fetch call and it would have to be decide, which fetch call must be canceled.
