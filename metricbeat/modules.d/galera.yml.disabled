  # Specifies the status variables to query from the cluster
  # Valid options are: "small", "full"

  # While "full" queries nearly all available variables, small only catches a small subset of it, which is:
  #  - wsrep_local_state_comment
  #  - wsrep_evs_state
  #  - wsrep_cluster_size
  #  - wsrep_cluster_status
  #  - wsrep_connected
  #  - wsrep_ready

  # Host DSN should be defined as "user:pass@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/"
  # The username and password can either be set in the DSN or using the username
  # and password config options. Those specified in the DSN take precedence.

  # Username of hosts. Empty by default.
  #username: root

  # Password of hosts. Empty by default.

  # By setting raw to true, all raw fields from the status metricset will be added to the event.
