=== Module-specific configuration notes

When configuring the `hosts` option, you must use a MySQL Data Source Name (DSN)
of the following format:

----
[username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/
----

You can also separately specify the username and password using the respective
configuration options. Usernames and passwords specified in the DSN take
precedence over those specified in the `username` and `password` config options.

----
- module: mysql
  metricsets: ["status"]
  hosts: ["tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/"]
  username: root
  password: secret


----

=== Compatibility

The galera MetricSets were tested with galera 3.22 (MySQL 5.7.20) and are expected to work with
all versions >= 3.0 (MySQL >= 5.7.0)



=== galera status MetricSet

This is the status metricset of the module galera.

Note: The galera_status metricset is in beta as we might merge it with the status metricset and we don't have tests for it yet.
