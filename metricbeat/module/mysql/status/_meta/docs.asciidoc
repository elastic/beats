The MySQL `status` metricset collects data from MySQL by running a
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-status.html[`SHOW GLOBAL STATUS;`]
SQL query. This query returns a large number of metrics.


==== raw config option

experimental[]

The MySQL Status Metricset supports the `raw` config option. When enabled, in
addition to the existing data structure, all fields available from the mysql
service through `"SHOW /*!50002 GLOBAL */ STATUS;"` will be added to the event.

These fields will be added under the namespace `mysql.status.raw`. The fields
can vary from one MySQL instance to an other and no guarantees are provided for
the  mapping of the fields as the mapping happens dynamically. This option is
intended for advanced use cases.
