:modulename!:

This module periodically fetches metrics from https://www.mysql.com/[MySQL]
servers.

The default metricset is `status`.

=== Module-specific configuration notes

When configuring the `hosts` option, you must use a MySQL Data Source Name (DSN)
of the following format:

----
[username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/
----

You can also separately specify the username and password using the respective
configuration options. Usernames and passwords specified in the DSN take
precedence over those specified in the `username` and `password` config options.

----
- module: mysql
  metricsets: ["status"]
  hosts: ["tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/"]
  username: root
  password: secret
----

=== Compatibility

The mysql MetricSets were tested with MySQL and Percona 5.7 and 8.0 and are expected
to work with all versions >= 5.7.0.
It is also tested with MariaDB 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4.
