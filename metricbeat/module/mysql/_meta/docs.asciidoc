=== Module-Specific Configuration Notes

When configuring the `hosts` option, you must use a MySQL Data Source Name (DSN) of the
following format:

----
[username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/
----

In case you use username and password in the DSN, this information will be sent with each event as part of the
`metricset.host` field. To prevent sending username and password the config options `username` and `password` can be used.

----
- module: mysql
  metricsets: ["status"]
  hosts: ["tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/"]
  username: root
  password: test
----

=== Compatibility

The mysql MetricSets were tested with mysql 5.7.12 and are expected to work with all versions >= 5.7.0.
