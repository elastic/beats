The Aerospike module uses the [Info command](http://www.aerospike.com/docs/reference/info) to collect metrics. The default metricset is `namespace`.


## Compatibility [_compatibility_5]

The Aerospike metricsets were tested with Aerospike Enterprise Edition 7.2.0.1 and are expected to work with all versions >= 4.9.


## Dashboard [_dashboard]

The Aerospike module comes with a predefined dashboard for Aerospike namespace, node specific stats. For example:
