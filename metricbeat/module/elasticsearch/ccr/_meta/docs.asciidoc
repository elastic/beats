This is the `ccr` metricset of the Elasticsearch module. It interrogates the
Cross-Cluster Replication Stats API endpoint to fetch metrics about cross-cluster
replication from the Elasticsearch clusters that are participating in cross-cluster
replication.

If the Elasticserach cluster does not have the cross-cluster replication feature
enabled, this metricset will not collect any metrics. A DEBUG log message about this
will be emitted in the Metricbeat log.
