=== elasticsearch node MetricSet

This is the node metricset of the module elasticsearch. It interrogates the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/cluster-nodes-info.html[Cluster API endpoint] of
Elasticsearch to get cluster nodes information. This metricset only fetches the data from the `_local` node so it must
run on each Elasticsearch node.
