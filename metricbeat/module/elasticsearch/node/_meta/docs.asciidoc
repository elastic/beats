=== elasticsearch node MetricSet

This is the node metricset of the module elasticsearch. It fetches stats from the `_nodes` https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-stats.html[API endpoint]. This metricset only fetches the data from the `_local` node so it must run on each elasticsearch node.
