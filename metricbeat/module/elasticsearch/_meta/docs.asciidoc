The Elasticsearch module contains a minimal set of metrics to enable monitoring of Elasticsearch across multiple versions. To monitor more Elasticsearch metrics, use our {monitoringdoc}/xpack-monitoring.html[X-Pack monitoring] which is available under a free basic license.

The default metricsets are `node` and `node_stats`.
