There are two modules that collect metrics about {es}: 

* The Elasticsearch module contains a minimal set of metrics to enable
monitoring of Elasticsearch across multiple versions. The default metricsets in
this module are `node` and `node_stats`.
* The Elasticsearch X-Pack module enables you to monitor more Elasticsearch
metrics with our {stack-ov}/xpack-monitoring.html[monitoring] feature. The
default metricsets in this module are `ccr`, `cluster_stats`, `index`,
`index_recovery`, `index_summary`, `ml_job`, `node_stats`, and `shard`.

=== Compatibility

The Elasticsearch module is tested with Elasticsearch 6.3 and is expected to
work with all 6.x versions.
