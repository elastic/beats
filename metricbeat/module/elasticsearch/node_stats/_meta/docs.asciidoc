=== elasticsearch node_stats MetricSet

This is the node_stats metricset of the module elasticsearch. It fetches data from `/_nodes/_local/stats`. The data received is only for the local node so this metricset has to be run on each elasticsearch node.

Note: The indices stats are node specific. That means for example the total number of docs reported by all nodes together is not the total number of documents in all indices as there can also be replicas.
