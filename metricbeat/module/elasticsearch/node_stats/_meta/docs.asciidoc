The `node_stats` metricset interrogates the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/cluster-nodes-stats.html[Cluster API endpoint] of
Elasticsearch to get the cluster nodes statistics. The data received is only for the local node so this Metricbeat has
to be run on each Elasticsearch node.

NOTE: The indices stats are node-specific. That means for example the total number of docs reported by all nodes together is not the total number of documents in all indices as there can also be replicas.
