This is the ingest_pipeline metricset of the module elasticsearch.

Collects metrics on ingest pipeline executions, with processor-level granularity.

=== Processor-level metrics sampling

Processor-level metrics can produce a high volume of data, so the default behavior is to collect those metrics less
frequently than the `period` for pipeline-level metrics, by applying a sampling strategy. By default, the
processor-level metrics will be collected during 25% of the time. This can be configured with the
`ingest.processor_sample_rate` setting:

- module: elasticsearch

    - ingest
  ingest.processor_sample_rate: 0.1 # decrease to 10% of fetches
