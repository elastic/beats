== Redis Module

This module periodically fetches metrics from http://redis.io/[Redis] servers.

=== Configuration Options

Redis has two additional config options:

* `idle_timeout` - Close connections after remaining idle for this duration. If
  the value is zero, then idle connections are not closed. The default value
  is 2 times the module period to allow a connection to be reused across
  fetches. The `idle_timeout` should be set less than the server's connection
  timeout.
* `network` - Network type to be used for redis connection. The default value is
  `tcp`.
* `maxconn` - Maximum number of concurrent connections to Redis. The default value
  is 10.
