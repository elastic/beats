beta[]

This module fetches metrics from https://www.docker.com/[Docker] containers.

The docker module is currently not tested on Windows.

=== Module-Specific Configuration Notes

It is strongly recommended that you run Docker metricsets with a
<<metricset-period,`period`>> that is 3 seconds or longer. The request to the
Docker API already takes up to 2 seconds. Specifying less than 3 seconds will
result in requests that timeout, and no data will be reported for those
requests.
