This is the node metricset of the module munin.

[float]
=== Features and configuration

The node metricset of the munin module collects metrics from a munin node agent
and sends them as events to Elastic.

[source,yaml]
---
- module: munin
  metricsets: ["node"]
  hosts: ["localhost:4949"]
  munin.plugins: ["cpu", "swap"]
---

Metrics exposed by a single munin node will be sent in an event per plugin.

For example with the previous configuration two events are sent like the
following ones.

[source,json]
---
"munin": {
  "plugin": {
    "name": "swap"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "swap_in": 198609,
    "swap_out": 612629
  }
}

"munin": {
  "plugin": {
    "name": "cpu"
  }
  "metrics": {
    "softirq": 680,
    "guest": 0,
    "user": 158212,
    "iowait": 71095,
    "irq": 1,
    "system": 35906,
    "idle": 1185709,
    "steal": 0,
    "nice": 1633
  }
}
---

In principle this module can be used to collect metrics from any agent that
implements the munin node protocol (http://guide.munin-monitoring.org/en/latest/master/network-protocol.html).

[float]
=== Limitations
Currently this module only collects metrics using the basic protocol. It doesn't
support capabilities or automatic dashboards generation based on munin
configuration.

[float]
=== Exposed fields, dashboards, indexes, etc.
Munin supports a great variety of plugins each of them can be used to obtain different
sets of metrics. Metricbeat cannot know the metrics exposed beforehand, so no field
description or dashboard is generated automatically.
