This module collects metrics from
https://jolokia.org/reference/html/agents.html[Jolokia agents] running on a
target JMX server or dedicated proxy server. The default metricset is `jmx`.

To collect metrics, {beatname_uc} communicates with a Jolokia HTTP/REST
endpoint that exposes the JMX metrics over HTTP/REST/JSON.
