    pool.

      fields:
      - name: accepted
        type: long
        description: >
          The number of incoming requests that the PHP-FPM server has accepted;
          when a connection is accepted it is removed from the listen queue.
      - name: queued
        type: long
        description: >
          The current number of connections that have been initiated, but not
          yet accepted. If this value is non-zero it typically means that all
          the available server processes are currently busy, and there are no
          processes available to serve the next request. Raising
          `pm.max_children` (provided the server can handle it) should help
          keep this number low. This property follows from the fact that
          PHP-FPM listens via a socket (TCP or file based), and thus inherits
          some of the characteristics of sockets.
      - name: max_listen_queue
        type: long
        description: >
          The maximum number of requests in the queue of pending

        Process state specific statistics.
      fields:
      - name: idle
        type: long
        description: >
          The number of servers in the `waiting to process` state (i.e. not
          currently serving a page). This value should fall between the
          `pm.min_spare_servers` and `pm.max_spare_servers` values when the
          process manager is `dynamic`.
      - name: active
        type: long
        description: >
          The number of servers current processing a page - the minimum is `1`
          (so even on a fully idle server, the result will be not read `0`).

          The number of idle + active processes.
