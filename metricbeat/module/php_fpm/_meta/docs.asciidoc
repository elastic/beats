servers.

=== Module-specific configuration notes

You need to enable the PHP-FPM status page by properly configuring
`pm.status_path`.

Here is a sample nginx configuration to forward requests to the PHP-FPM status
page (assuming `pm.status_path` is configured with default value `/status`):

----
nginx
location ~ /status {
     allow 127.0.0.1;
     deny all;
     include fastcgi_params;
     fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
     fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
}
----

=== Compatibility

The PHP_FPM metricsets were tested with PHP 7.1.1 and are expected to
work with all versions >= 5.
