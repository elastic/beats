The Ceph module collects metrics by submitting HTTP GET requests to
the https://docs.ceph.com/docs/jewel/man/8/ceph-rest-api/[ceph-rest-api]. The default metricsets are `cluster_disk`, `cluster_health`, `monitor_health`, `pool_disk`, `osd_tree`.

Metricsets connecting to the Ceph REST API uses by default the service exposed on port 5000.
Metricsets using the Ceph Manager Daemon communicate with the API exposed by default on port 8003 (SSL encryption).
