This module fetches metrics from Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubelet/[kubelet]
agent and https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics[kube-state-metrics] service.

All metricsets with the `state_` prefix require `hosts` field pointing to kube-stat-metrics
service within the cluster, while the rest should be pointed to kubelet service. Check the
example configuration on how to do it.
