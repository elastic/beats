As one of the main pieces provided for Kubernetes monitoring, this module is capable of fetching metrics from several components:

- https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet]
- https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics[kube-state-metrics]
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/[apiserver]
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/[controller-manager]
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/[scheduler]
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/[proxy]

Some of the previous components are running on each of the Kubernetes nodes (like `kubelet` or `proxy`) while others provide a single cluster-wide endpoint. This is important to determine the optimal configuration and running strategy for the different metricsets included in the module.

For a complete reference on how to configure and run this module on Kubernetes as part of a `DaemonSet` and a `Deployment`, there's a complete example manifest available in <<running-on-kubernetes, Running Metricbeat on Kubernetes>> document.

=== Kubernetes endpoints and metricsets

Kubernetes module is a bit complex as its internal metricsets require access to a wide variety of endpoints.

This section highlights and introduces some groups of metricsets with similar endpoint access needs. For more details on the metricsets see `configuration example` and the `metricsets` sections below.

[float]
==== node / system / pod / container / module

The default metricsets `container`, `node`, `pod`, `system` and `volume` require access to the `kubelet endpoint` in each of the Kubernetes nodes, hence it's recommended to include them as part of a `Metricbeat DaemonSet` or standalone Metricbeats running on the hosts.

Depending on the version and configuration of Kubernetes nodes, `kubelet` might provide a read only http port (typically 10255), which is used in some configuration examples. But in general, and lately, this endpoint requires SSL (`https`) access (to port 10250 by default) and token based authentication.

[float]
==== state_* and event

All metricsets with the `state_` prefix require `hosts` field pointing to `kube-state-metrics
service` within the cluster. As the service provides cluster-wide metrics, there's no need to fetch them per node, hence the recommendation is to run these metricsets as part of a `Metricbeat Deployment` with one only replica.

Note: Kube-state-metrics is not deployed by default in Kubernetes. For these cases the instructions for its deployment are available https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics#kubernetes-deployment[here]. Generally `kube-state-metrics` runs a `Deployment` and is accessible via a service called `kube-state-metrics` on `kube-system` namespace, which will be the service to use in our configuration.

[float]
==== apiserver

The apiserver metricset requires access to the Kubernetes API, which should be easily available in all Kubernetes environments. Depending on the Kubernetes configuration, the API access might require SSL (`https`) and token based authentication.

[float]
==== proxy

The proxy metricset requires access to the proxy endpoint in each of Kubernetes nodes, hence it's recommended to configure it as a part of a `Metricbeat DaemonSet`.

[float]
==== scheduler and controllermanager

These metricsets require access to the Kubernetes `controller-manager` and `scheduler` endpoints. By default, these pods run only on master nodes, and they are not exposed via a Service, but there are different strategies available for its configuration:

- Create `Kubernetes Services` to make `kube-controller-manager` and `kube-scheduler` available and configure the metricsets to point to these services as part of a Metricbeat `Deployment`.
- Use `Autodiscovery` functionality as part of a Metricbeat DaemonSet and include the metricsets in a conditional template applied for the specific pods.

Note: In some "As a Service" Kubernetes implementations, like `GKE`, the master nodes or even the pods running on the masters won't be visible. In these cases it won't be possible to use `scheduler` and `controllermanager` metricsets.

[float]
=== Kubernetes RBAC

Metricbeat requires certain cluster level privileges in order to fetch the metrics. The following example creates a `ServiceAcount` named `metricbeat` with the necessary permissions to run all the metricsets from the module. A `ClusterRole` and a `ClusterRoleBinding` are created for this purpose:

[source,yaml]

=== Compatibility

The Kubernetes module is tested with Kubernetes 1.13.x, 1.14.x, 1.15.x, 1.16.x, 1.17.x, and 1.18.x

[float]
=== Dashboard

Kubernetes module is shipped including default dashboards for `apiserver`, `controllermanager`, `scheduler` and `proxy`.

If you are using HA for those components, be aware that when gathering data from all instances the dashboard will usually show and average of the metrics. For those scenarios filtering by hosts or service address is possible.

Dashboards for `controllermanager` `scheduler` and `proxy` are not compatible with kibana versions below `7.2.0`
