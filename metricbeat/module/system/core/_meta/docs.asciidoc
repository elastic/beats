=== Configuration

*`core.metrics`*:: This option controls what metrics are reported for each CPU
core. The value is a list and two metric types are supported - `percentages` and
`ticks`. The default value is `core.metrics: [percentages]`.
*`use_performance_counters`*:: This option enables the use of performance counters to 
collect data for the CPU/core metricset. It is only effective on Windows.
You should use this option if running beats on machins with more than 64 cores.
The default value is `use_performance_counters: true`
