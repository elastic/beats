The System `fsstat` metricset provides overall file system statistics.

This metricset is available on:

- FreeBSD
- Linux
- macOS
- OpenBSD
- Windows

=== Configuration

*`filesystem.ignore_types`* - A list of filesystem types to ignore. Metrics will
not be collected from filesystems matching these types. This setting also
affects the `filesystem` metricset. If this option is not set, metricbeat ignores
all types for virtual devices in systems where this information is available (e.g.
all types marked as `nodev` in `/proc/filesystems` in Linux systems).
