== Additional Config options

The system module offers two additional config options.


[float]
=== processes

The config option `processes: ['.*']` can be used if the `process` MetricSet is enabled. It allows to define a list
of regexp expressions to filter the processes which are reported. By default all processes are reported.
For more complex filtering, the filters configuration option should be used. An example config can look as following:

[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
- module: system
  metricsets: ["process"]
  processes: ['.*']
----


[float]
=== cpu_ticks

For config option `cpu_ticks: false` can be used if the `cpu` or `core` MetricSet is enabled. If the config option
`cpu_ticks` is enabled, not only cpu precentages stats will be reported but also the cpu ticks. An example config can
be found below:

[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
- module: system
  metricsets: ["cpu", "core"]
  cpu_ticks: true
----

[float]
=== Dashboard

The system module comes with its predefined dashboard. An example is shown below.
