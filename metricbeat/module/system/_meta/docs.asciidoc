The System module allows you to monitor your servers. Because the System module
always applies to the local server, the `hosts` config option is not needed.

The default metricsets are `cpu`, `load`, `memory`, `network`, `process`, and
`process_summary`. To disable a default metricset, comment it out in the
`modules.d/system.yml` configuration file. If _all_ metricsets are commented out
and the System module is enabled, {beatname_uc} uses the default metricsets.

Note that certain metricsets may access `/proc` to gather process information,
and the resulting `ptrace_may_access()` call by the kernel to check for
permissions can be blocked by
https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/wikis/TechnicalDoc_Proc_and_ptrace[AppArmor
and other LSM software], even though the System module doesn't use `ptrace`
directly.

=== Dashboard

The System module comes with a predefined dashboard. For example:
