The System module allows you to monitor your servers. Because the System module
always applies to the local server, the `hosts` config option is not needed.

The default metricsets are `cpu`, `load`, `memory`, `network`, `process` and
`process_summary`.

Note that certain metricsets may access `/proc` to gather process information, and the resulting `ptrace_may_access()` call by the kernel to check for permissions can be blocked by https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/wikis/TechnicalDoc_Proc_and_ptrace[AppArmor and other LSM software], even though the system module doesn't use `ptrace` directly.
