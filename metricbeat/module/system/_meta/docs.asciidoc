== System Module

The System module allows you to monitor your servers. Because the System module always applies to the local
server, the `hosts` config option is not needed.

=== Module-Specific Configuration Notes

The System module has these additional config options:

*`processes`*:: When the `process` metricset is enabled, you can use the `processes` option to define a list of
regexp expressions to filter the processes that are reported. For more complex filtering, you should use the
<<configuration-processors, processors>> configuration option.
+
The following example config returns metrics for all processes:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
- module: system
  metricsets: ["process"]
  processes: ['.*']
----
*`process.cgroups.enabled`*:: When the `process` metricset is enabled, you can
use this boolean configuration option to disable cgroup metrics. By default
cgroup metrics collection is enabled.
+
The following example config disables cgroup metrics on Linux.
+
[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
- module: system
  metricsets: ["process"]
  process.cgroups.enabled: false
----
*`cpu_ticks`*:: When the `cpu` or `core` metricset is enabled, you can specify `cpu_ticks: true` to report CPU ticks in addition to CPU percentages stats. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
- module: system
  metricsets: ["cpu", "core"]
  cpu_ticks: true
----

It is strongly recommended to not run docker metricsets with a period smaller then 3 seconds. The request to the docker
API already takes up to 2s seconds. Otherwise all the requests would timeout and no data is reported.

=== Dashboard

The System module comes with a predefined dashboard. For example:
