            Actual free memory in bytes. It is calculated based on the OS. On Linux this value will be MemAvailable from /proc/meminfo, 
            or calculated from free memory plus caches and buffers if /proc/meminfo is not available.
            On OSX it is a sum of free memory and the inactive memory. On Windows, it is equal
            to `system.memory.free`.
