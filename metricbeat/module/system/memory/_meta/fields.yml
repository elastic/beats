    - name: free
      type: long
      description: >
        The total amount of free memory in bytes. This value does not include memory consumed by system caches and
        buffers (see system.memory.actual.free).

        Actual memory used and free.
      fields:

        - name: used.bytes
          type: long
          description: >
            Actual used memory in bytes. It represents the difference between the total and the available memory. The
            available memory depends on the OS. For more details, please check `system.actual.free`.
 
        - name: free
          type: long
          description: >
            Actual free memory in bytes. It is calculated based on the OS. On Linux it consists of the free memory
            plus caches and buffers. On OSX it is a sum of free memory and the inactive memory. On Windows, it is the 
            amount of unreserved and uncommitted memory currently in the user-mode portion of the virtual address space
            of the calling process.
