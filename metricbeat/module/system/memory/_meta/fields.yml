            Actual used memory in bytes. It represents the difference between the total and the available memory. The
            available memory depends on the OS. For more details, please check `system.actual.free`.

            Actual free memory in bytes. It is calculated based on the OS. On Linux it consists of the free memory
            plus caches and buffers. On OSX it is a sum of free memory and the inactive memory. On Windows, it is equal
            to `system.memory.free`.
