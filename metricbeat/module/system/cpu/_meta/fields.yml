    `cpu` contains local CPU stats.
  fields:
    - name: cores
      type: long
      description: >
        The number of CPU cores.

    - name: user.pct
      type: scaled_float
      format: percent
      description: >
        The percentage of CPU time spent in user space. On multi-core systems, you can have percentages that are greater than 100%.
        For example, if 3 cores are at 60% use, then the `cpu.user_p` will be 180%.
