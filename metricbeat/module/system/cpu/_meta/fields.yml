        The number of CPU cores present on the host. The non-normalized
        percentages will have a maximum value of `100% * cores`. The
        normalized percentages already take this value into account and have
        a maximum value of 100%.

      description: >
        The percentage of CPU time spent in user space. On multi-core systems,
        you can have percentages that are greater than 100%. For example, if 3
        cores are at 60% use, then the `system.cpu.user.pct` will be 180%.
