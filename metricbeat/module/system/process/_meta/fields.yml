            The cpu subsystem schedules CPU access for tasks in the cgroup.
            Access can be controlled by two separate schedulers, CFS and RT.
            CFS stands for completely fair scheduler which proportionally
            divides the CPU time between cgroups based on weight. RT stands for
            real time scheduler which sets a maximum amount of CPU time that
            processes in the cgroup can consume during a given period.
            In CPU under cgroups V2, the cgroup is merged with many of the metrics
            from cpuacct. In addition, per-scheduler metrics are gone in V2.
