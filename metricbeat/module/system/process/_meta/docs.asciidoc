=== System Process Metricset

The System `process` metricset provides process statistics. One document is
provided for each process.

This metricset is available on:

- Darwin
- FreeBSD
- Linux
- Windows

=== Control Group (cgroup) Metrics

On Linux this metricset will collect metrics from any cgroups that the process
is a member of. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled by adding
`process.cgroup.enabled: false` to the system module configuration.

=== Process Environment Variables

This metricset can collect the environment variables that were used to start the
process. This feature is available on Linux, Darwin, and FreeBSD. No environment
variables are collected by default because they could contain sensitive information.
You must configure the environment variables that you wish to collect by
specifying a list of regular expressions that match the variable name.
