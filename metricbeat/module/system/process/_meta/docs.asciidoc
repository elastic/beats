=== System Process Metricset

The System `process` metricset provides process statistics. One document is
provided for each process.

This metricset is available on:

- Darwin
- FreeBSD
- Linux
- Windows

=== Control Group (cgroup) Metrics

On Linux this metricset can collect metrics from any cgroups that the process
is a member of. This feature is currently experimental, and it is not enabled by
default so you must add `cgroup: true` to the system module configuration to
enable it.
