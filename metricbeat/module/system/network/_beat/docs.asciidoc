=== System Network MetricSet

The System Network MetricSet provides network IO metrics collected from the
operating system. One event is created for each network interface.

By default metrics are reported from all network interfaces. To select which
interfaces that metrics are reported from, use the `interfaces` configuration
options. The value must be an array of interface names. For example:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------
metricbeat.modules:
- module: system
  metricsets: [network]
  interfaces: [eth0]
----------------------------

This MetricSet is available on:

- Darwin
- Linux
- Windows
- FreeBSD
