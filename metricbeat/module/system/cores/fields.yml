    `system-cores` contains local cpu core stats.
  fields:
    - name: core
      type: integer
      description: >
        CPU Core number.

    - name: user
      type: integer
      description: >
       The amount of CPU time spent in user space.

    - name: user_p
      type: float
      description: >
        The percentage of CPU time spent in user space. On multi-core systems, you can have percentages that are greater than 100%.
        For example, if 3 cores are at 60% use, then the `cpu.user_p` will be 180%.
