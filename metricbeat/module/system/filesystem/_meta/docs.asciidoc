=== Filtering

Often there are mounted filesystems that you do not want Metricbeat to report
metrics on. A simple strategy to deal with these filesystems is to configure a
drop_event filter that matches the `mount_point` using a regular expression.
Below is an example.

[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
  - module: system
    period: 30s
    metricsets: ["filesystem"]
    filters:
      - drop_event.when.regexp.mount_point: '^/(sys|cgroup|proc|dev|etc|host)($|/)'
