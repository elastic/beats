The System `filesystem` metricset provides file system statistics. For each file
system, one document is provided.

This metricset is available on:

- FreeBSD
- Linux
- macOS
- OpenBSD
- Windows

=== Configuration

*`filesystem.ignore_types`* - A list of filesystem types to ignore. Metrics will
not be collected from filesystems matching these types. This setting also
affects the `fsstats` metricset. If this option is not set, metricbeat ignores
all types for virtual devices in systems where this information is available (e.g.
all types marked as `nodev` in `/proc/filesystems` in Linux systems).

=== Filtering

Often there are mounted filesystems that you do not want Metricbeat to report
metrics on. One option is to configure Metricbeat to ignore specific filesystem
types. This can be accomplished by configuring `filesystem.ignore_types` with
a list of filesystem types to ignore. In this example we are ignoring three
types of filesystems.

[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
  - module: system
    period: 30s
    metricsets: ["filesystem"]
    filesystem.ignore_types: [nfs, smbfs, autofs]
----

Another strategy to deal with these filesystems is to configure a `drop_event`
processor that matches the `mount_point` using a regular expression. This type
of filtering occurs after the data has been collected so it can be less
efficient than the previous method.

[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
  - module: system
    period: 30s
    metricsets: ["filesystem"]
    processors:
    - drop_event.when.regexp:
        system.filesystem.mount_point: '^/(sys|cgroup|proc|dev|etc|host)($|/)'
