This is the Windows module which collects metrics from Windows systems.
The module contains the `service` metricset, which is set up by default when the windows module is enabled.
The `service` metricset will retrieve status information of the services on the Windows machines. The other windows
metricset is `perfmon` which collects windows performance counter values.
