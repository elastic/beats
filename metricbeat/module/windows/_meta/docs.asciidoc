This is the `windows` module which collects metrics from Windows systems.
The module contains the `service` metricset, which is set up by default when the `windows` module is enabled.
The `service` metricset will retrieve status information of the services on the Windows machines. The second `windows`
metricset is `perfmon` which collects Windows performance counter values.
