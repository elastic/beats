=== Windows Perfmon MetricSet

This is the perfmon metricset of the Windows module. It reads Windows
performance counters.

[float]
=== Configuration

You must configure queries for the Windows performance counters that you wish
to collect. The example below collects processor time and disk writes.
With `format` you can set the output format for a specific counter. Possible values are
`float` and `long`. If nothing is selected the default value is `float`.
There is also an optional/required option `instance_name`.
You have to set this in two cases. First if you want to name your instance other then it is computed. e.g `Total` instead of `_Total`.
And second if you specify a counter which has no instance, for example: `\TCPIP Performance Diagnostics\IPv4 NBLs/sec indicated without prevalidation`.
Then this option is required. For wildcard queries this option is needles.
