The `service` metricset of the Windows module reads the status of Windows
services.

=== Filtering

Processors can be used to filter the events based on the service states or
their names. The example below configures the metricset to drop all events
except for the events for the firewall service. See
<<filtering-and-enhancing-data>> for more information about using processors.

[source,yaml]
----
- module: windows
  metricsets: ["service"]
  period: 60s
  processors:
  - drop_event.when.not.equals:
      windows.service.display_name: Windows Firewall
