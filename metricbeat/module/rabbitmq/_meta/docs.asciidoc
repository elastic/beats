The RabbitMQ module uses http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html[HTTP API] created by the management plugin to collect metrics.

The default metricsets are `connection`, `node`, `queue` and `exchange`.

If `management.path_prefix` is set in RabbitMQ configuration, `management_path_prefix` has to be set to the same value in this module configuration.

=== Compatibility

The rabbitmq module is tested with RabbitMQ 3.7.4, and it should be compatible
with any version supporting the management plugin. This plugin needs to be
enabled.
