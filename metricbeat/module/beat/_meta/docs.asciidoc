There are two modules that collect metrics about any Beat or other software based on libbeat:

* The `beat` module tracks only the high-level metrics. The default metricsets in
this module are `state` and `stats`.
* The `beat-xpack` module enables you to monitor more Beat metrics with our
{stack} {monitor-features}. The metricsets automatically configured by this module
are `state` and `stats`.

=== Compatibility
