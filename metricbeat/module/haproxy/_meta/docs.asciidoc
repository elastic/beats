== HAProxy Module

This is the haproxy Module.  To enable stats collection from HAProxy, you must enable the stats socket via TCP.
For example, placing the following statement under the `global` or `default` section of the haproxy config:

`stats socket 127.0.0.1:14567`

will enable stats reporting via any local IP on port 14567.  Please note that you should probably use an internal private IP
or secure this with a firewall rule so that only designated hosts can access this data.

=== Compatibility

The HAProxy metricsets were tested with HAProxy 1.6 and are expected to work with all 1.6 versions.
