There are two modules that collect metrics about {ls}:

* The `logstash` module tracks only the high-level metrics. The default metricsets in
this module are `node` and `node_stats`.
* The `logstash-xpack` module enables you to monitor more {ls} metrics with our
{stack} {monitor-features}. The metricsets automatically configured by this module
are `node` and `node_stats`.

=== Compatibility
