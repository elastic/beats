the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of

along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

goconvey-master.zip\goconvey-master\web\client\resources\fonts\Orbitron\OFL.txt

Copyright (c) 2009, Matt McInerney (matt@pixelspread.com), with Reserved Font
Name Orbitron.  This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font
License, Version 1.1.  This license is copied below, and is also available
with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL


----------------------------------------------------------- SIL OPEN FONT
LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open
framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or
sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
derivatives.

DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the
Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright
statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or
substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Original
Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or
other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any
person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge,
embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the
Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original
or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains
the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as
stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate
machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s)
unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright
Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to
the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified
Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s)
and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be
distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any
other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not
apply to any document created using the Font Software.

TERMINATION This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions
are not met.

DISCLAIMER THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF
COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN
AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT
SOFTWARE.

entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
permissions granted by this License.  

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and

made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is
included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix
below).

Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or
bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for
inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal
Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes
of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or
written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including
but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code
control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty- free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with
the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.  You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
of this License; and

  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
You changed the files; and

  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
part of the Derivative Works; and

  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of
the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement
to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms
and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction,
and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.  Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.  This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work
and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.  Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.  In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.  While redistributing the Work
or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

license:

under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display,
perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an
unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third partys
modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version);
or

under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
(see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights
to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they
can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict
the recipients rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable
Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means
in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the
recipient; and

You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights
in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their
option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this
License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
liability specific to any jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if
such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means,
this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this
License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an as is basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of
defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The
entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with
You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License
except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of
the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply
to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such partys
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
prevent a partys ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name
of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original
works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other
rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are
for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of
our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by
those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways
otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of
the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all
rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject
to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used
under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for
licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified
terms and conditions. If the licensors permission is not necessary for any
reasonfor example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyrightthen that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all
changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for
the public.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights
in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor
receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1  Definitions.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that
is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified
in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held
by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material
is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation
with a moving image.  Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your
Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.  Copyright
and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to
copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound
recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights
are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations
under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,
and/or similar international agreements.  Exceptions and Limitations means
fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright
and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.  Licensed Rights
means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this
Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority
to license.  Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.  Share means to provide material to the public by
any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available
to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the
material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.  Sui Generis
Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive
96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the
legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other
essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.  You means the individual
or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a
corresponding meaning.

Section 2  Scope.

License grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
in part; and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.  Exceptions and
Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations
apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to
comply with its terms and conditions.  Term. The term of this Public License
is specified in Section 6(a).  Media and formats; technical modifications
allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all
media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make
technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees
not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical
modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For
purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by
this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.  Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor  Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public
License.  No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.  No
endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as
permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official
status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

Other rights.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not
otherwise.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
License.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly
or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3  License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

Attribution.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested
by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); a copyright notice; a
notice that refers to this Public License; a notice that refers to the
disclaimer of warranties; a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
extent reasonably practicable; indicate if You modified the Licensed Material
and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and indicate the
Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text
of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.  You may satisfy the
conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium,
means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it
may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to
a resource that includes the required information.  If requested by the
Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section
3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.  If You Share Adapted
Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent
recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Section 4  Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual
contents) is Adapted Material; and You must comply with the conditions in
Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5  Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes,
without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects,
accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in
part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.  To the extent possible, in no
event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including,
without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special,
indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses,
costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the
Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is
not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall
be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6  Term and Termination.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured,
provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.  For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies
for Your violations of this Public License.  For the avoidance of doubt, the
Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or
conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however,
doing so will not terminate this Public License.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8
survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7  Other Terms and Conditions.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  Any arrangements,
understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated
herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this
Public License.

Section 8  Interpretation.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of
the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
this Public License.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public
License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  No term or condition of
this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to
unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.  Nothing in this Public License
constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any
privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from
the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding,
Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it
publishes and in those instances will be considered the Licensor.
Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a
Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative
Commons policies published at creativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons
does not authorize the use of the trademark Creative Commons or any
other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent
including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized
modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements,
understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material. For the
avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not form part of the public licenses.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE

IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other
form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose
of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work,
performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this License.

   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
License.

   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
transfer of ownership.

   e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in
the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
of this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing;
a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or
dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a

analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or
a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not
otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances;
to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public
may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by
them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the
communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by
public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means
including signs, sounds or images.

without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights
in the Work as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
original work has been modified.";

   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt:

      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right
to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
this License;

      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
and,

      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member
of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License.  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section
4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the
terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any
credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied;
(iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to
the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use
the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
Attribution Parties.

   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
(e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under
Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED
TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR
THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals
or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force
and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
agreement of the Licensor and You.

   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take
effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite
of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license
of any rights under applicable law.
