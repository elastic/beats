This is the `stats` metricset of the Kibana module. This stats endpoint is available in 6.4 by default.

The intention of the Kibana module is to have a minimal data set that works across Kibana versions.

=== Module-specific configuration notes

If the Kibana instance is using a basepath in its URL, you must set the `basepath` setting for this module with the same value.
