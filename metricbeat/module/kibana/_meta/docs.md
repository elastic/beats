{{agent}} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and more. Refer to the documentation for a detailed [comparison of {{beats}} and {{agent}}](docs-content://reference/fleet/index.md).

The `kibana` module collects metrics about {{kib}}.


## Compatibility [_compatibility_30]

The `kibana` module works with {{kib}} 6.7.0 and later.


## Usage for {{stack}} Monitoring [_usage_for_stack_monitoring_4]

The `kibana` module can be used to collect metrics shown in our {{stack-monitor-app}} UI in {{kib}}. To enable this usage, set `xpack.enabled: true` and remove any `metricsets` from the moduleâ€™s configuration. Alternatively, run `metricbeat modules disable kibana` and `metricbeat modules enable kibana-xpack`.

::::{note}
When this module is used for {{stack}} Monitoring, it sends metrics to the monitoring index instead of the default index typically used by {{metricbeat}}. For more details about the monitoring index, see [Configuring indices for monitoring](docs-content://deploy-manage/monitor/monitoring-data/configuring-data-streamsindices-for-monitoring.md).
