This is the webserver metricset of the module iis.


This metricset allows users to retrieve relevant metrics from IIS.

Metric values are divided in several groups:

The `process` object contains System/Process counters like the the overall server and CPU usage for the IIS Worker Processes and memory (currently used and available memory for the IIS Worker Processes).

The `network` object contains the IIS Performance counters like:
Web Service: Bytes Received/Sec (helpful to track to identify potential spikes in traffic), Web Service: Bytes Sent/Sec (helpful to track to identify potential spikes in traffic),
Web Service: Current Connections (through experience with their apps app, users can identify what is a normal value for this) and others.

The `cache` object contains metrics from the user mode cache and output cache.
