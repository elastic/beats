This metricset periodically fetches JMX metrics from Kafka Broker JMX.

[float]
=== Compatibility
The module has been tested with Kafka 2.1.1. Other versions are expected to work.

[float]
=== Usage
The Broker metricset requires <<metricbeat-module-jolokia,Jolokia>>to fetch JMX metrics. Refer to the link for instructions about how to use Jolokia.

Note that the Jolokia agent is required to be deployed along with the Kafka JVM application. This can be achieved by
using the `KAFKA_OPTS` environment variable when starting the Kafka broker application:

[source,shell]
----
export KAFKA_OPTS=-javaagent:/opt/jolokia-jvm-1.5.0-agent.jar=port=8779,host=localhost
./bin/kafka-server-start.sh ./config/server.properties
----

Then it will be possible to collect the JMX metrics from `localhost:8779`.
