This metricset periodically fetches JMX metrics from Kafka Consumers implemented in java and expose JMX metrics through jolokia agent.

[float]
=== Compatibility
The module has been tested with Kafka 2.1.1. Other versions are expected to work.

[float]
=== Usage
The Consumer metricset requires <<metricbeat-module-jolokia,Jolokia>>to fetch JMX metrics. Refer to the link for more information about Jolokia.

Note that the Jolokia agent is required to be deployed along with the JVM application. This can be achieved by
using the `KAFKA_OPTS` environment variable when starting the Kafka consumer application:

[source,shell]
----
export KAFKA_OPTS=-javaagent:/opt/jolokia-jvm-1.5.0-agent.jar=port=8774,host=localhost
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic=test --bootstrap-server=localhost:9091
----

Then it will be possible to collect the JMX metrics from `localhost:8774`.
