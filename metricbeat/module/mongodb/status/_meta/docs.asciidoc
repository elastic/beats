This is the `status` metricset of the MongoDB module.

It requires the following privileges:

- https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/privilege-actions/#serverStatus[`serverStatus` action] on https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/resource-document/#cluster-resource[`cluster` resource]

You can use the following command in Mongo shell to create the role (make sure you are using the `admin` db by using `db` command in Mongo shell).

["source","js",subs="attributes"]
----
db.createRole(
   {
     role: "statusRole",
     privileges: [
       { resource: { cluster: true }, actions: ["serverStatus"] }
     ],
     roles: []
   }
)
----

You can then use the following command in Mongo shell to create the privileged user (make sure you are using the `admin` db by using `db` command in Mongo shell).

["source","js",subs="attributes"]
----
db.createUser(
    {
        user: "beats",
        pwd: "pass",
        roles: ["statusRole"]
    }
)
----

You can use the following command in Mongo shell to grant the role to an existing user (make sure you are using the `admin` db by using `db` command in Mongo shell).

["source","js",subs="attributes"]
----
db.grantRolesToUser("user", ["statusRole"])
