        The fields in metrics.commands are the names of database commands and each value is a document
        that reports the total number of commands executed as well as the number of failed executions.

        metrics.commands.<command>.failed shows the number of times <command> failed on this mongod.
        metrics.commands.<command>.total shows the number of times <command> executed on this mongod.
