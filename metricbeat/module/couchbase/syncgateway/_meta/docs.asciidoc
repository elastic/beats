Sync Gateway is the synchronization server in a Couchbase for Mobile and Edge deployment. This metricset allows to monitor a Sync Gateway instance by using its REST API.

Sync Gateway access `[host]:[port]/_expvar` on Sync Gateway nodes to fetch metrics data, ensure that the URL is accessible from the host where Metricbeat is running.

=== Skipping some events

As mentioned before, this metricset generates 4 types of events under `couchbase.syncgateway.*` JSON path: DB stats, global stats, Memory stats and per replication stats. Only DB stats are always sent but you can choose to skip the others. For example, if you just want DB stats, you'll configuration will look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
- module: couchbase
  metricsets:
    - syncgateway
  period: 10s
  hosts: ["myhost:4985"]
  skip:
    memstats: true
    global_stats: true
    per_replication: true
----

By default, all data is shipped to elasticsearch.
