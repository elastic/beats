This is the JetStream metricset of the NATS module. It supports gathering basic stats about a JetStream server as well as specific details about streams and consumers.

The data is pulled from the https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/monitoring#jetstream-information-jsz[/jsz] API of a JetStream server.

=== Configuration

You can enable each of the specific data points via configuration for the `jetstream` metricset. For example:

[source,yaml]
jetstream:
  stats:
    # Enables basic stats collection about the JetStream server
    enabled: true
  account:
    # Enables data collection about accounts on the server 
    enabled: true
  stream:
    # Enables data collection about streams on the server 
    enabled: true
  consumer:
    # Enables data collection about consumers on the server 
    enabled: true

You can also filter account, stream, and consumer metrics by name:

[source,yaml]
jetstream:
  account:
    names:
      - default
      - another account
  stream:
    names:
      - my-stream-1
      - my-stream-2
  consumer:
    names:
      - my-stream-1-consumer-1
      - my-stream-1-consumer-2

Since this data is hierarchical, these filters are cumulative and apply even if the particular data set is not enabled but filters are configured. When there are no names configured, all information about all accounts, streams, and consumers will be reported.
