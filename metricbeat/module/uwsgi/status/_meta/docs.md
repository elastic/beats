This module periodically fetches metrics from [uWSGI](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StatsServer.html) servers.


## Compatibility [_compatibility_50]

The uWSGI metricsets were tested with uWSGI 2.0.15 and are expected to work with all version >= 1.4.9

This is a default metricset. If the host module is unconfigured, this metricset is enabled by default.
