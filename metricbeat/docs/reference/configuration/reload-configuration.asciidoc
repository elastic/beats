=== Reload Configuration

beta[]

Reload configuration allows to dynamically reload module configuration files. A glob can be defined which should be watched
 for module configuration changes. New modules will started / stopped accordingly. This is especially useful in
 container environments where 1 container is used to monitor all services in other containers on the same host.
 New containers appear and disappear dynamically which requires changes to which modules
 are needed and which hosts must be monitored.

The configuration in the main metricbeat.yml config file looks as following:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
metricbeat.config.modules:
  path: configs/*.yml
  reload.enabled: true
  reload.period: 10s
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A path with a glob must be defined on which files should be checked for changes. A period is set on how often
the files are checked for changes. Do not set period below 1s as the modification time of files is often stored in seconds.
Setting it below 1s will have an unnecessary overhead.

The configuration inside the files which are found by the glob look as following:
[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- module: system
  metricsets: ["cpu"]
  enabled: false
  perdiod: 1s

- module: system
  metricsets: ["network"]
  enabled: true
  period: 10s
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each file directly contains a list of modules. Each file can contain one or multiple module definitions.
