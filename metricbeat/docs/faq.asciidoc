=== "open /compat/linux/proc: no such file or directory" error on FreeBSD

The system metricsets rely on a Linux compatibility layer to retrieve metrics on
FreeBSD. You need to mount the Linux procfs filesystem using the following
commands. You may want to add these filesystems to your `/etc/fstab` so they are
mounted automatically.

[source,sh]
----
sudo mount -t procfs proc /proc
sudo mkdir -p /compat/linux/proc
sudo mount -t linprocfs /dev/null /compat/linux/proc
