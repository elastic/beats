The panw Metricbeat module uses the Palo Alto [pango](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pango#section-documentation) package to extract metrics
information from a firewall device via the XML API.

=== Module-specific configuration notes

The panw module configuration requires the ip address of the target firewall device and an API Key generated from that firewall. It is assumed
that network access to the firewall is available. All access by the panw module is read-only.

***Limitations***
The current version of the module is configured to run against **exactly 1** firewall. Multiple firewalls will require multiple agent configurations. 
The module has also not been tested with Panorama, though it should work since it only relies on lower level Client.Op calls to send XML API commands 
to the server.

Required credentials for the `panw` module:

`host_ip` :: IP address of the firewall - must be network accessible.

`apiKey`:: An API Key generated via an XML API call to the firewall or via the management dashboard. This

== Metricsets

[float]
=== `bgp_peers`
This metricset reports information on BGP Peers defined in the firewall.

[float]
=== `certificates`
This metricset will capture certificates defined on the firewall including expiration dates.

[float]
=== `fans`
This metricset will collect information from hardware fans (RPMS) and will report if an alarm is active for a given fan.

[float]
=== `filesystem`
This metricset reports disk usage for filesystems defined on the device, based on df output.

[float]
=== `globalprotect_sessions`
This metricset will collect metrics on current user sessions established on Global Protect gateways.

[float]
=== `globalprotect_stats`
This metricset reports the number of user per GlobalProtect gateway and totals across all gateways.

[float]
=== `ha_interfaces`
This metricset will collect metrics from the device on High Availabilty configuration for interfaces.

[float]
=== `licenses`
This metricset reports on licenses for sofware features with expiration dates.

[float]
=== `logical`
This metricset will collect metrics on logical interfaces in the device's network.

[float]
=== `power`
This metricset reports power usage and alarms.

[float]
=== `system`
This metricset captures system informate such as uptime, user count, CPU, memory and swap: essentiallyl the first 5 lines of 'top' output. 

[float]
=== `temperature`
This metricset reports temperature for various slots on the device and reports on alarm status. 

[float]
=== `tunnels`
This metricset enumerates ipsec tunnels and their status.
