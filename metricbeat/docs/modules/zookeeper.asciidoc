[[metricbeat-module-zookeeper]]
== ZooKeeper module

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/integration-link.asciidoc[]

:modulename!:

The ZooKeeper module fetches statistics from the ZooKeeper service. The default
metricsets are `mntr` and `server`.

[float]
=== Compatibility

The ZooKeeper metricsets were tested with ZooKeeper 3.4.8, 3.6.0 and 3.7.0. They are expected to work with all versions
>= 3.4.0. Versions prior to 3.4 do not support the `mntr` command.

Note that from ZooKeeper 3.6.0, `mntr`, `stat`, `ruok`, `conf`, `isro`, `cons` command must be explicitly enabled at ZooKeeper side using the `4lw.commands.whitelist` configuration parameter.

[float]
=== Dashboard

The Zookeeper module comes with a predefined dashboard:
