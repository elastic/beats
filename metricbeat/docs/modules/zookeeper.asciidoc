== ZooKeeper module

The ZooKeeper module fetches statistics from the ZooKeeper service. The default
metricset is `mntr` and `server`.

=== Compatibility

The ZooKeeper metricsets were tested with ZooKeeper 3.4.8 and are expected to work with all version
>= 3.4.0. Versions prior to 3.4 do not support the `mntr` command.
