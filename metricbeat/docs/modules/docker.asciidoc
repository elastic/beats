[[metricbeat-module-docker]]
== Docker module

beta[]

This module fetches metrics from https://www.docker.com/[Docker] containers.

The Docker module is currently not tested on Windows.

=== Module-specific configuration notes

It is strongly recommended that you run Docker metricsets with a
<<metricset-period,`period`>> that is 3 seconds or longer. The request to the
Docker API already takes up to 2 seconds. Specifying less than 3 seconds will
result in requests that timeout, and no data will be reported for those
requests.

=== Example configuration

The Docker module supports the standard configuration options that are described
in <<configuration-metricbeat>>. Here is an example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
- module: docker
  metricsets: ["container", "cpu", "diskio", "healthcheck", "info", "memory", "network"]
  hosts: ["unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]
  period: 10s

  # To connect to Docker over TLS you must specify a client and CA certificate.
  #ssl:
    #certificate_authority: "/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"
    #certificate:           "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
    #key:                   "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
