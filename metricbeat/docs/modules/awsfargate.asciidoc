== AWS Fargate module

beta[]

Amazon ECS on Fargate provides a method to retrieve various metadata, network
metrics, and Docker stats about tasks and containers. This is referred to as the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/task-metadata-endpoint-v4-fargate.html[task metadata endpoint]
and this endpoint is available per container.

The environment variable is injected by default into the containers of Amazon
ECS tasks on Fargate that use platform version 1.4.0 or later and Amazon ECS
tasks on Amazon EC2 that are running at least version 1.39.0 of the Amazon ECS
container agent.

The awsfargate module is a Metricbeat module which collects AWS fargate metrics
from task metadata endpoint.

== Introduction to AWS ECS and Fargate
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage
containers. ECS has two launch types that can define how compute resources will
be managed: ECS EC2 and ECS Fargate.

* *ECS EC2*

ECS EC2 launches containers that run on EC2 instances. Users have to manage EC2
instances. Pricing depends on the number of EC2 instances running.

One can monitor these containers by deploying Metricbeat on the corresponding EC2 instances with the
Metricbeat Docker module enabled.

In order to achieve this one will need:
--
. to ensure access to these EC2 instances using ssh keys
coupled with EC2 instances (attach ssh keys on cluster creation using `Key pair` option)
. to enable shh access for the instances with the
proper https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html[inbound rules].
--

* *ECS Fargate*

ECS Fargate removes the responsibility of provisioning, configuring, and
managing the EC2 instances by allowing AWS to manage the EC2 instances. Users
only need to specify containers and tasks. Pricing based on the number of tasks.

== Task Metadata Endpoint
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/task-metadata-endpoint-v4-fargate.html[Task metadata endpoint]
returns https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.30/#operation/ContainerStats[Docker stats]
in JSON format for all the containers associated with the task.
This endpoint is only available from within the task definition itself, which
means Metricbeat needs to be run as a sidecar container within the task
definition. Since the metadata endpoint is only accessible from within the
Fargate Task, there is no authentication in place.

== Metricsets
Currently, we have `task_stats` metricset in `awsfargate` module.

[float]
=== `task_stats`
This metricset collects runtime CPU metrics, disk I/O metrics, memory metrics,
network metrics and container metadata from both endpoint
`${ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4}/task/stats` and `${ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4}/task`.
