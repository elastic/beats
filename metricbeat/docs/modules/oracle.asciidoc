[role="xpack"]
== Oracle module

This is the https://www.oracle.com[Oracle] module for Metricbeat. It is under active development with feedback from the community. A single Metricset for Tablespace monitoring is added so the community can start gathering metrics from their nodes and contributing to the module.

[float]
== Compatibility
Oracle Metricbeat module is being tested version 12c R2 by using the store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1 Docker image downloaded directly from the https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition[Oracle Docker Hub repository]
which is based on 5.0.13-arch1-1-ARCH Arch Linux. This is important, the module has only been tested with the mentioned image in Linux environments.

== Dashboard
An overview dashboard for Kibana is already included:

== Requirements

*Oracle Database Connection Pre-requisites*

To get connected with the Oracle Database ORACLE_SID, ORACLE_BASE, ORACLE_HOME environment variables should be set.

For example: Let’s consider Oracle Database 21c installation using RPM manually by following https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/ladbi/running-rpm-packages-to-install-oracle-database.html[this] link, environment variables should be set as follows:
    `ORACLE_SID=ORCLCDB`
    `ORACLE_BASE=/opt/oracle/oradata`
    `ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/product/21c/dbhome_1`
Also, add `ORACLE_HOME/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

*Oracle Instant Client*

Oracle Instant Client enables development and deployment of applications that connect to Oracle Database. The Instant Client libraries provide the necessary network connectivity and advanced data features to make full use of Oracle Database. If you have OCI Oracle server which comes with these libraries pre-installed, you don't need a separate client installation.

The OCI library install few Client Shared Libraries that must be referenced on the machine where Metricbeat is installed. Please follow https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/lacli/install-instant-client-using-zip.html#GUID-D3DCB4FB-D3CA-4C25-BE48-3A1FB5A22E84[this] link for OCI Instant Client set up. The OCI Instant Client is available with the Oracle Universal Installer, RPM file or ZIP file. Download links can be found https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html[here].

*Enable Listener*

The Oracle listener is a service that runs on the database host and receives requests from Oracle clients. Make sure that https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/network.102/b14213/lsnrctl.htm[listener] should be running. 
To check if the listener is running or not, run: 

`lsnrctl STATUS`

If the listener is not running, use the command to start:

`lsnrctl START`

Then, Metricbeat can be launched.

[float]
== Metricsets

The following Metricset is included in the module:

[float]
=== `tablespaces`

Includes information about data files and temp files, grouped by Tablespace with free space available, used space, status of the data files, status of the Tablespace, etc.
