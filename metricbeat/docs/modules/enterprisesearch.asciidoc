== Enterprise Search module

beta[]

This module periodically fetches metrics and health information from Elastic Enterprise Search instances using HTTP APIs.

[float]
=== Compatibility
The module has been tested with Enterprise Search versions 7.16.0 and higher. Versions below 7.16.0 are not expected to work due to a number of API-level incompatibilities.

[float]
=== Usage
The Enterprise Search module requires a set of credentials (a username and a password) for an Elasticserch user for a user that has a `monitor` https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[cluster privilege].

[float]
=== Usage for {stack} Monitoring

The Enterprise Search module can be used to collect metrics shown in our {stack-monitor-app}
UI in {kib}. To enable this usage, set `xpack.enabled: true` in configuration.

NOTE: When this module is used for {stack} Monitoring, it sends metrics to the
monitoring index instead of the default index typically used by {metricbeat}.
For more details about the monitoring index, see
{ref}/config-monitoring-indices.html[Configuring indices for monitoring].
