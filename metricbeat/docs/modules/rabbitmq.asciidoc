[[metricbeat-module-rabbitmq]]
== RabbitMQ module

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/integration-link.asciidoc[]

:modulename!:

The RabbitMQ module uses http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html[HTTP API] created by the management plugin to collect metrics.

The default metricsets are `connection`, `node`, `queue` and `exchange`.

If `management.path_prefix` is set in RabbitMQ configuration, `management_path_prefix` has to be set to the same value in this module configuration.

[float]
=== Compatibility

The rabbitmq module is fully tested with RabbitMQ 3.7.4 and it should be compatible with any version supporting the management plugin (which needs to be installed and enabled). Exchange metricset is also tested with 3.6.0, 3.6.5 and 3.7.14
