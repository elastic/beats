== CouchDB module

This is the couchdb module.

The default metricset is `server`.

[float]
=== Compatibility

The Couchdb module is tested in CI with Couchdb 1.7 and 2.3. Because of the differences between v1 and v2 for exposing metrics, the path to request metrics for each version is different:

* v1.* uses `[host]:5984/_stats` so the hosts of your config should just be `[host]:5984`
* v2.* exposes metrics in various places. Local in `[host]:5986/_stats` and cluster wide in `[host]:5984/_node/[node-name]/_stats` or `[host]:5984/_node/_local/_stats`. Recommended config is `[host]:5986` to use the local path (double check that you are using port `5986`) or to use the full path on `5984`  `[host]:5984/_node/[node name or _local]/_stats`


[float]
=== Dashboard

The CouchDB module comes with a predefined dashboard for CouchDB database specific stats. For example:
