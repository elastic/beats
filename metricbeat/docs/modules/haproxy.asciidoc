== HAProxy Module

This module collects stats from http://www.haproxy.org/[HAProxy]. To configure
HAProxy to collect stats, you must enable the stats socket via TCP. For example,
to enable stats reporting via any local IP on port 14567, place this statement
under the `global` or `default` section of the haproxy config:

`stats socket 127.0.0.1:14567`

NOTE: You should use an internal private IP, or secure this with a firewall
rule, so that only designated hosts can access this data.

=== Compatibility

The HAProxy metricsets were tested with HAProxy 1.6 and are expected to work with all 1.6 versions.
