=== {beatname_uc} collects system metrics for interfaces you didn't configure

The <<metricbeat-module-system,`system`>> module specifies several metricsets
that are enabled by default unless you explicitly disable them. To disable the
default metricsets, comment them out in the `modules.d/system.yml` configuration
file.

For example, to disable the `network` metricset, comment it out:

[source,yaml]
----
  - module: system
    period: 10s
    metricsets:
      - cpu
      - load
      - memory
      #- network
      - process
      - process_summary
      - socket_summary
      #- entropy
      #- core
      #- diskio
      #- socket
----

You cannot override the default configuration by adding another module
definition to the configuration. There is no concept of inheritance.
{beatname_uc} combines all module configurations at runtime. This enables you to
specify module definitions that use different combinations of metricsets,
periods, and hosts.
