=== Filtering the Exported Data

When your use case requires only a subset of the data exported by Metricbeat,
you can <<metricbeat-filtering-overview,use Metricbeat config options to filter
the data>>, or you can <<generic-filtering-overview-metricbeat,use the generic
filtering provided by libbeat>>.

==== Metricbeat Module Filtering

Each module accepts a list of filters in its configuration. These filters are
applied to the data generated by the module. These filters are applied to the
module data prior to the addition of the common beat fields like `beat.hostname`
and `type` so they can only be used to filter fields from the module.

The following example reduces the exported fields of the Redis module to
include only the `redis-info.memory` fields.

[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat:
  modules:
    - module: redis
      metricsets: ["info"]
      period: 1s
      hosts: ["127.0.0.1:6379"]
      enabled: true
      filters:
        - include_fields.fields: ['redis-info.memory']

==== Generic Filtering

include::../../libbeat/docs/filtering.asciidoc[]

For example, the following filter configuration reduces the exported fields by
dropping the `beat.name` field from all documents.

[source, yaml]
----
filter:
 - drop_fields.fields: ['beat.name']
----

See <<configuration-filter,filter configuration options>> for more information.
