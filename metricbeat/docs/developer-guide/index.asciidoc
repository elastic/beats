Metricbeat is periodically interrogating other services to fetch key metrics
information. As a developer Metricbeat can be used in two different ways:

* Extend Metricbeat directly
* Create your own beat and use Metricbeat as a library

We recommend to start with your own beat as it keeps the development of your own module / metricset indepent.
If it should be added a later stage as a module in Metricbeat, the same code can be reused and not additional
changes are needed.

If you are looking to contribute in general to beats or the foundation of
metricbeat, also have a look at the
https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[general contributor guide].

== Overview

Metricbeat consists of modules and metricsets. A metricbeat module is normally
called the same as the service the metrics should be fetch from (e.g. redis,
mysql, ...). Each module can contain multiple metricsets. A metricset represents
multiple metrics which are normally retrieved with one request from the remote
system (e.g. redis-info, mysql-status).

== Module & Metricsets Requirements

It is important for us that only high quality modules are part of metricbeat to
guarantee the best user experience. Modules and Metricsets which are contributed
must fulfill the following requirements:

* Complete fields.yml to generate docs and elasticsearch templates
* Documentation files
* Integration tests
* 80% test coverage (unit, integration, system tests combined)

Metricbeat allows to build a wide variety of modules and metricset on top of it.
The module which will be accepted should be focused on fetching service metrics
directly from a service itself and not via a third party tool. The goal is to
have as few movable parts as possible and that metricbeat runs as close as
possible to the service which should be monitored.
