== Metricbeat Developer Guide FAQ

This is a list of common questions when creating a MetricSet and the potential answers to it.

[float]
=== MetricSet is not Complie

You are compiling your Beat but the newly created MetricSet is not compiled?

Make sure that the path to your module and MetricSet are added as an import path either in your `main.go`
file or your `include/list.go` file. This can be done manually or by running `make imports`.

[float]
=== MetricSet is not started

The MetricSet is compiled but not started when starting MetricBeat?

After creating your MetricSet, make sure to run `make collect`. This will add the configuration
of your MetricSet to the default configuration. In case it still does not start, check your
default configuration file if it is listed there.
