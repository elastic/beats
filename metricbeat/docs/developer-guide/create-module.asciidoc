== Creating a Metricbeat Module

Metricbeat modules are used to group multiple metricsets together and to implement shared functionality
of the metricsets. In most cases, no implementation of the module is needed and the default module
implementation is automatically picked.

It's important to complete the configuration and documentation files for a module. When you create a new
metricset by running `make create-metricset`, default versions of these files are generated in the `_meta` directory.

=== Module Files

* `config.yml` and `config.full.yml`
* `docs.asciidoc`
* `fields.yml`

After updating any of these files, make sure you run `make update` in your beat directory so all generated
files are updated.


[float]
==== config.yml and config.full.yml

The `config.yml` file contains the basic configuration options and looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../scripts/module/config.yml[]
----

It contains the module name, your metricset, and the default period. If you have multiple
metricsets in your module, make sure that you extend the metricset array:

[source,yaml]
----
  metricsets: ["{metricset1}", "{metricset2}"]
----

The `full.config.yml` file is optional and by default has the same content as the `config.yml`. It is used
to add and document more advanced configuration options that should not be part of the minimal
config file shipped by default.

[float]
==== docs.asciidoc

The `dosc.asciidoc` file contains the documentation about your module. During generation of the
documentation, the default config file will be appended to the docs. Use this file to describe your
module in more detail and to document specific configuration options.

[source,asciidoc]
----
include::../../scripts/module/docs.asciidoc[]
----

[float]
==== fields.yml

The `fields.yml` file contains the top level structure for the fields in your metricset. It's used in combination with
the `fields.yml` file in each metricset to generate the template and documentation for the fields.

The default file looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../scripts/module/fields.yml[]
----

Make sure that you update at least the description of the module.

=== Testing

It's a common pattern to use a `testing.go` file in the module package to share some testing functionality among
the metricsets. This file does not have `_test.go` in the name because otherwise it would not be compiled for sub packages.

To see an example of the `testing.go` file, look at the https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/metricbeat/module/mysql[mysql module].
