== Overview

Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that you can install on your servers to
periodically collect metrics from the operating system and the services running
on the server.

Metricbeat helps you monitor your servers by collecting metrics from services
like:

*Service metrics*

  * <<metricbeat-apache-module,Apache HTTPD>>
  * <<metricbeat-mysql-module,MySQL>>
  * <<metricbeat-redis-module,Redis>>

Metricbeat can insert the collected metrics directly into Elasticsearch
or send them to Logstash, Redis, or Kafka.
