[[configuration-general-options]]
== Specify general settings

You can specify settings in the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file to control the
general behavior of {beatname_uc}. This includes:

* <<configuration-global-options,Global options>> that control things like
the maximum random delay to apply to the startup of a metricset.

* <<configuration-general,General options>> that are supported by all Elastic
Beats.

==== `metricbeat.max_start_delay`

The maximum random delay to apply to the startup of a metricset. Random delays
ranging from [0, _max_start_delay_) are applied to reduce the thundering herd
effect that can occur if a fleet of machines running Metricbeat are restarted at
the same time. Specifying a value of 0 disables the startup delay. The default
is 10s.

metricbeat.max_start_delay: 10s

[float]
==== `timeseries.enabled`

Setting this to true (false by default) will add a `timeseries.instance` field
to all events generated by {beatname_uc}. For a given metricset, this field will
be unique for every single item being monitored.

[source,yaml]
----
timeseries.enabled: true
