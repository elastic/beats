  ### Elasticsearch as output
  elasticsearch:

    # Set to true to enable elasticsearch output
    enabled: true

    # Array of hosts to connect to.
    # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
    # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
    # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
    hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

    # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials. These are deprectad
    #protocol: "https"
    #username: "admin"
    #password: "s3cr3t"

    # Elasticsearch. The default is false.
    # This option makes sense only for Packetbeat
    #save_topology: false

    # Optional index name. The default is "beatname" and generates
    # [beatname-]YYYY.MM.DD keys.
    #index: "beatname"

    # Optional HTTP Path
    #path: "/elasticsearch"

    # The number of times a particular Elasticsearch index operation is attempted. If
    # the indexing operation doesn't succeed after this many retries, the events are
    # dropped. The default is 3.
    #max_retries: 3

    # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Elasticsearch bulk API index request.
    # The default is 10000.
    #bulk_max_size: 10000

    # The number of seconds to wait for new events between two bulk API index requests.
    # If `bulk_max_size` is reached before this interval expires, addition bulk index
    # requests are made.
    #flush_interval

    # Boolean that sets if the topology is kept in Elasticsearch. The default is
    # false. This option makes sense only for Packetbeat.
    #save_topology:

    #The time to live in seconds for the topology information that is stored in
    #Elasticsearch. The default is 15 seconds.
    #topology_expire:

    # tls configuration
    #tls:
      # If disabled is set to true, the tls section will be ignored and the
      # host its certificate authorities will be used.

      # Controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host name.
      # If insecure is set to true, all server host names and certificates will be
      # accepted. In this mode TLS based connections are susceptible to
      # man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing.

  ### Logstash as output

    # Uncomment out this option if you want to output to Logstash. The default is false.
    #enabled: true

    # The Logstash hosts
    #hosts: ["localhost:5044", "logstash:5045"]

    # Optional load balance the events between the Logstash hosts

  ### File as output
  #file:
    # Enabling file output
    #enabled: false

    # Path to the directory where to save the generated files. The option is mandatory.
    #path: "/tmp/packetbeat"

    # Name of the generated files. The default is `packetbeat` and it generates files: `packetbeat`, `packetbeat.1`, `packetbeat.2`, etc.
    #filename: packetbeat

    # Maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, the files are
    # rotated. The default value is 10 MB.
    #rotate_every_kb: 10000

    # Maximum number of files under path. When this number of files is reached, the
    # oldest file is deleted and the rest are shifted from last to first. The default
    # is 7 files.
    #number_of_files: 7


############################# Shipper #########################################

shipper:
  # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
  # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
  # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
  #name:

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.
  #tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
  # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.

  # How often (in seconds) shippers are publishing their IPs to the topology map.
  # The default is 10 seconds.
  #refresh_topology_freq: 10

  # Expiration time (in seconds) of the IPs published by a shipper to the topology map.
  # All the IPs will be deleted afterwards. Note, that the value must be higher than
  # refresh_topology_freq. The default is 15 seconds.
  #topology_expire: 15

  # Configure local GeoIP database support. If no paths are configured
  # the locations /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat and
