output:

  ### Elasticsearch as output
  elasticsearch:

    # Set to true to enable elasticsearch output
    enabled: true

    # A list of Elasticsearch hosts. If the connection to the first host fails, it connects to the second one.
    # A host can be defined as an IP:PORT or an URL with the format: scheme://IP:PORT/path. In case you specify and
    # additional path, the scheme is required. The defaults are ( port is 9200, path is '/', scheme is http).
    # In case of an IPv6 address, please use http://[2001:db8::1]:9200.
    hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]

    # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials. These are deprectad
    #protocol: "https"
    #username: "admin"
    #password: "s3cr3t"

    # Optional index name. The default is "topbeat" and generates
    # [topbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD keys.
    #index: "topbeat"

    # Optional HTTP Path
    #path: "/elasticsearch"

    # The number of times a particular Elasticsearch index operation is attempted. If
    # the indexing operation doesn't succeed after this many retries, the events are
    # dropped. The default is 3.
    #max_retries: 3

    # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Elasticsearch bulk API index request.
    # The default is 10000.
    #bulk_max_size: 10000

    # The number of seconds to wait for new events between two bulk API index requests.
    # If `bulk_max_size` is reached before this interval expires, addition bulk index
    # requests are made.
    #flush_interval

    #The time to live in seconds for the topology information that is stored in
    #Elasticsearch. The default is 15 seconds.
    #topology_expire:

    # tls configuration
    #tls:
      # If disabled is set to true, the tls section will be ignored and the
      # host its certificate authorities will be used.

      # Controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host name.

  ### Logstash as output
  #logstash:
    # Uncomment out this option if you want to output to Logstash. The default is false.
    #enabled: true

    # The Logstash hosts
    #hosts: ["localhost:5044", "logstash:5045"]

    # Optional load balance the events between the Logstash hosts
    #loadbalance: true

    # Optional index name. The default index name is topbeat
    #index: topbeat

    # Optional TLS. The default is on

  ### File as output
  #file:
    # Enabling file output
    #enabled: false

    # Path to the directory where to save the generated files. The option is mandatory.
    #path: "/tmp/topbeat"

    # Name of the generated files. The default is `topbeat` and it generates
    # files: `topbeat`, `topbeat.1`, `topbeat.2`, etc.
    #filename: topbeat

    # Maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, the files are
    # rotated. The default value is 10 MB.
    #rotate_every_kb: 10000

    # Maximum number of files under path. When this number of files is reached, the
    # oldest file is deleted and the rest are shifted from last to first. The default
    # is 7 files.
    #number_of_files: 7


############################# Shipper #########################################

shipper:

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
