################### Packetbeat Configuration Example ##########################

# This file contains an overview of various configuration settings. Please consult
# the docs at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/packetbeat-configuration.html
# for more details.

# The Packetbeat shipper works by sniffing the network traffic between your
# application components. It inserts meta-data about each transaction into
# Elasticsearch.

############################# Sniffer #########################################

# Select the network interfaces to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
interfaces:
  device: any

############################# Protocols #######################################
protocols:
  icmp:
    # Enable ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 monitoring. Default: false
    enabled: true

  dns:
    # Configure the ports where to listen for DNS traffic. You can disable
    # the DNS protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [53]

    # include_authorities controls whether or not the dns.authorities field
    # (authority resource records) is added to messages.
    # Default: false
    include_authorities: true
    # include_additionals controls whether or not the dns.additionals field
    # (additional resource records) is added to messages.
    # Default: false
    include_additionals: true

    # send_request and send_response control whether or not the stringified DNS
    # request and response message are added to the result.
    # Nearly all data about the request/response is available in the dns.*
    # fields, but this can be useful if you need visibility specifically
    # into the request or the response.
    # Default: false
    # send_request:  true
    # send_response: true

  amqp:
    # Configure the ports where to listen for AMQP traffic. You can disable
    # the AMQP protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [5672]
    # Truncate messages that are published and avoid huge messages being
    # indexed.
    # Default: 1000
    #max_body_length: 1000
    # Hide the header fields in header frames.
    # Default: false
    #parse_headers: false
    # Hide the additional arguments of method frames.
    # Default: false
    #parse_arguments: false
    # See all methods relative to connection negociation between server and
    # client.
    #hide_connection_information: false

  http:
    # Configure the ports where to listen for HTTP traffic. You can disable
    # the HTTP protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [80, 8080, 8000, 5000, 8002]

    # Uncomment the following to hide certain parameters in URL or forms attached
    # to HTTP requests. The names of the parameters are case insensitive.
    # The value of the parameters will be replaced with the 'xxxxx' string.
    # This is generally useful for avoiding storing user passwords or other
    # sensitive information.
    # Only query parameters and top level form parameters are replaced.
    # hide_keywords: ['pass', 'password', 'passwd']

  memcache:
    # Configure the ports where to listen for memcache traffic. You can disable
    # the Memcache protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [11211]

    # Uncomment the parseunknown option to force the memcache text protocol parser
    # to accept unknown commands.
    # Note: All unknown commands MUST not contain any data parts!
    # Default: false
    # parseunknown: true

    # Update the maxvalue option to store the values - base64 encoded - in the
    # json output.
    # possible values:
    #    maxvalue: -1  # store all values (text based protocol multi-get)
    #    maxvalue: 0   # store no values at all
    #    maxvalue: N   # store up to N values
    # Default: 0
    # maxvalues: -1

    # Use maxbytespervalue to limit the number of bytes to be copied per value element.
    # Note: Values will be base64 encoded, so actual size in json document
    #       will be 4 times maxbytespervalue.
    # Default: unlimited
    # maxbytespervalue: 100

    # UDP transaction timeout in milliseconds.
    # Note: Quiet messages in UDP binary protocol will get response only in error case.
    #       The memcached analyzer will wait for udptransactiontimeout milliseconds
    #       before publishing quiet messages. Non quiet messages or quiet requests with
    #       error response will not have to wait for the timeout.
    # Default: 200
    # udptransactiontimeout: 1000

  mysql:
    # Configure the ports where to listen for MySQL traffic. You can disable
    # the MySQL protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [3306]

    # the Redis protocol by commenting out the list of ports.

    # Configure the ports where to listen for MongoDB traffic. You can disable
    # the MongoDB protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [27017]

############################# Processes #######################################

# Configure the processes to be monitored and how to find them. If a process is
# monitored then Packetbeat attempts to use it's name to fill in the `proc` and
# `client_proc` fields.
# The processes can be found by searching their command line by a given string.
#
# Process matching is optional and can be enabled by uncommenting the following
# lines.
#
#procs:
#  enabled: false
#  monitored:
#    - process: mysqld
#      cmdline_grep: mysqld
