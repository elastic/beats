###################### Packetbeat Configuration Example #######################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see packetbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/index.html

#============================== Network device ================================

# Select the network interface to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
packetbeat.interfaces.device: any

# Packetbeat supports three sniffer types:
# * pcap, which uses the libpcap library and works on most platforms, but it's
# not the fastest option.
# * af_packet, which uses memory-mapped sniffing. This option is faster than
# libpcap and doesn't require a kernel module, but it's Linux-specific.
# * pf_ring, which makes use of an ntop.org project. This setting provides the
# best sniffing speed, but it requires a kernel module, and it's Linux-specific.
# The default sniffer type is pcap.
#packetbeat.interfaces.type: pcap

# The maximum size of the packets to capture. The default is 65535, which is
# large enough for almost all networks and interface types. If you sniff on a
# physical network interface, the optimal setting is the MTU size. On virtual
# interfaces, however, it's safer to accept the default value.
#packetbeat.interfaces.snaplen: 65535

# The maximum size of the shared memory buffer to use between the kernel and
# user space. A bigger buffer usually results in lower CPU usage, but consumes
# more memory. This setting is only available for the af_packet sniffer type.
# The default is 30 MB.
#packetbeat.interfaces.buffer_size_mb: 30

# Packetbeat automatically generates a BPF for capturing only the traffic on
# ports where it expects to find known protocols. Use this settings to tell
# Packetbeat to generate a BPF filter that accepts VLAN tags.
#packetbeat.interfaces.with_vlans: true

# Use this setting to override the automatically generated BPF filter.
#packetbeat.interfaces.bpf_filter:

#================================== Flows =====================================

# Set network flow timeout. Flow is killed if no packet is received before being
# timed out.
packetbeat.flows.timeout: 30s

# Configure reporting period. If set to -1, only killed flows will be reported
packetbeat.flows.period: 10s

  # (authority resource records) is added to messages.
  # Default: false
  include_authorities: true
  # include_additionals controls whether or not the dns.additionals field
  # (additional resource records) is added to messages.
  # Default: false
  include_additionals: true

  # send_request and send_response control whether or not the stringified DNS
  # request and response message are added to the result.
  # Nearly all data about the request/response is available in the dns.*

  # UDP transaction timeout in milliseconds.
  # Note: Quiet messages in UDP binary protocol will get response only in error case.
  #       The memcached analyzer will wait for udptransactiontimeout milliseconds

#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
# combination of these.
#fields:
#  env: staging

# If this option is set to true, the custom fields are stored as top-level
# fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields
# sub-dictionary. Default is false.
#fields_under_root: false

# Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
# by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful

#================================ Processors =====================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to 
# enhance the event with external meta data. This section defines a list of processors 
# that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# Supported processors: drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep
# the fields that contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that
# contain CPU ticks values:
#
#processors:
#- include_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu"]
#- drop_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#- drop_event:
#    when:
#       equals:
#           http.code: 200

#================================= Paths ======================================

# The home path for the packetbeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all other path settings and for miscellaneous files that come with the
# distribution (for example, the sample dashboards).
# If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the
# home path is the location of the binary.
#path.home:

# The configuration path for the packetbeat installation. This is the default
# base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
#path.config:

# The data path for the packetbeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all the files in which packetbeat needs to store its data. If not set by a
# CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the data path is a data
# subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.data:

# The logs path for a packetbeat installation. This is the default location for
# the Beat's log files. If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file,
# the default for the logs path is a logs subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.logs:

#================================ Logging =====================================
# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windows systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.

# Sets log level. The default log level is error.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: error

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: true

# If enabled, packetbeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. The default is true.
#logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# Logging to rotating files files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# files.
logging.to_files: true
logging.files:
  # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
  # under the home path (the binary location).
  #path: /var/log/mybeat

  # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
  #name: mybeat

  # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
  # automatically rotated
  #rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

  # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
