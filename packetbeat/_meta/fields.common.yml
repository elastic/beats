      migration: true
      description: >
        If the server initiating the transaction is a proxy, this field
        contains the original client IP address.
        For HTTP, for example, the IP address extracted from a configurable
        HTTP header, by default `X-Forwarded-For`.

        Unless this field is disabled, it always has a value, and it matches
        the `client_ip` for non proxy clients.

    - name: transport
      type: alias
      path: network.transport
      migration: true
      description: >
        The transport protocol used for the transaction. If not specified, then
        tcp is assumed.

  description: >
    These fields contain data about the flow itself.
  fields:
    - name: flow.final
      type: boolean
      description: >
        Indicates if event is last event in flow. If final is false, the event
        reports an intermediate flow state only.

        Internal flow ID based on connection meta data and address.

    - name: flow.vlan
      type: long
      description: >
        VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame
        this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed
        first.

  description: >
    These fields contain data about the transaction itself.
  fields:
    - name: status
      description: >
        The high level status of the transaction. The way to compute this
        value depends on the protocol, but the result has a meaning
        independent of the protocol.
      required: true
      possible_values:
        - OK
        - Error
        - Server Error
        - Client Error

    - name: method
      description: >
        The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the
        method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb
        (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on).

    - name: resource
      description: >
        The logical resource that this transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is
        the URL path up to the last slash (/). For example, if the URL is
        `/users/1`, the resource is `/users`. For databases, the resource is
        typically the table name. The field is not filled for all transaction
        types.

    - name: path
      required: true
      description: >
        The path the transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL.
        For SQL databases, this is the table name. For key-value stores, this
        is the key.

    - name: query
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The query in a human readable format. For HTTP, it will typically be
        something like `GET /users/_search?name=test`. For MySQL, it is
        something like `SELECT id from users where name=test`.

    - name: params
      type: text
      description: >
        The request parameters. For HTTP, these are the POST or GET parameters.
        For Thrift-RPC, these are the parameters from the request.

    - name: notes
      type: alias
      path: error.message
      description: >
        Messages from Packetbeat itself. This field usually contains error
        messages for interpreting the raw data. This information can be helpful
        for troubleshooting.

- key: raw
  title: Raw
  description: These fields contain the raw transaction data.
  fields:
    - name: request
      type: text
      description: >
        For text protocols, this is the request as seen on the wire
        (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our
        representation of the request.

    - name: response
      type: text
      description: >
        For text protocols, this is the response as seen on the wire

    - name: bytes_in
      type: alias
      path: source.bytes
      description: >
        The number of bytes of the request. Note that this size is
        the application layer message length, without the length of the IP or
        TCP headers.

    - name: bytes_out
      type: alias
      path: destination.bytes
      description: >
        The number of bytes of the response. Note that this size is
