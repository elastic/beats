###################### Packetbeat Configuration Example #######################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see packetbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/index.html

#============================== Network device ================================

# Select the network interface to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
packetbeat.interfaces.device: any

# Packetbeat supports three sniffer types:
# * pcap, which uses the libpcap library and works on most platforms, but it's
# not the fastest option.
# * af_packet, which uses memory-mapped sniffing. This option is faster than
# libpcap and doesn't require a kernel module, but it's Linux-specific.
#packetbeat.interfaces.type: pcap

# The maximum size of the packets to capture. The default is 65535, which is
# large enough for almost all networks and interface types. If you sniff on a
# physical network interface, the optimal setting is the MTU size. On virtual
# interfaces, however, it's safer to accept the default value.
#packetbeat.interfaces.snaplen: 65535

# The maximum size of the shared memory buffer to use between the kernel and
# user space. A bigger buffer usually results in lower CPU usage, but consumes
# more memory. This setting is only available for the af_packet sniffer type.
# The default is 30 MB.
#packetbeat.interfaces.buffer_size_mb: 30

# Packetbeat automatically generates a BPF for capturing only the traffic on
# ports where it expects to find known protocols. Use this settings to tell
# Packetbeat to generate a BPF filter that accepts VLAN tags.
#packetbeat.interfaces.with_vlans: true

# Use this setting to override the automatically generated BPF filter.
#packetbeat.interfaces.bpf_filter:

#================================== Flows =====================================

packetbeat.flows:
  # Enable Network flows. Default: true
  #enabled: true

  # Set network flow timeout. Flow is killed if no packet is received before being
  # timed out.
  timeout: 30s

  # Configure reporting period. If set to -1, only killed flows will be reported
  period: 10s

  # Uncomment the following to hide certain parameters in URL or forms attached
  # to HTTP requests. The names of the parameters are case insensitive.
  # The value of the parameters will be replaced with the 'xxxxx' string.
  # This is generally useful for avoiding storing user passwords or other
  # sensitive information.
  # Only query parameters and top level form parameters are replaced.
