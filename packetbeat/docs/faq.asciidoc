=== Why are the client_server and server fields empty?

The `client_server` and `server` fiels will be empty if you have not configured Packetbeat
to capture information about the network topology.

To capture information about the network topology, you need to set the `save_topology` configuration option to true and make sure that you are sending the output to Elasticsearch.
