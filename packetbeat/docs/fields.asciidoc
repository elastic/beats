format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.milliZ

required: True

The timestamp of the event, as measured either by the Beat or by a common collector point. The precision is in milliseconds. The timezone is UTC.


==== type

required: True

The type of the transaction (for example, HTTP, MySQL, Redis, or RUM).


==== direction

required: True

Indicates whether the transaction is inbound (emitted by server) or outbound (emitted by the client). Values can be in or out. No defaults.


==== status

required: True

The high level status of the transaction. The way to compute this value depends on the protocol, but the result has a meaning independent of the protocol.


==== method

The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on).


==== resource

The logical resource that this transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL path up to the last slash (/). For example, if the URL is `/users/1`, the resource is `/users`. For databases, the resource is typically the table name. The field is not filled for all transaction types.


==== path

required: True

The path the transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL. For SQL databases, this is the table name. For key-value stores, this is the key.


==== query

type: keyword

The query in a human readable format. For HTTP, it will typically be something like `GET /users/_search?name=test`. For MySQL, it is something like `SELECT id from users where name=test`.


==== params

type: text

The request parameters. For HTTP, these are the POST or GET parameters. For Thrift-RPC, these are the parameters from the request.


==== notes

Messages from Packetbeat itself. This field usually contains error messages for interpreting the raw data. This information can be helpful for troubleshooting.


[[exported-fields-trans_measurements]]
=== Measurements (Transactions) Fields

These fields contain measurements related to the transaction.



==== responsetime

type: long

The wall clock time it took to complete the transaction. The precision is in milliseconds.


==== cpu_time

type: long

The CPU time it took to complete the transaction.

==== bytes_in

type: long

The number of bytes of the request. Note that this size is the application layer message length, without the length of the IP or TCP headers.


==== bytes_out

type: long

The number of bytes of the response. Note that this size is the application layer message length, without the length of the IP or TCP headers.


==== dnstime

type: long

The time it takes to query the name server for a given request. This is typically used for RUM (real-user-monitoring) but can also have values for server-to-server communication when DNS is used for service discovery. The precision is in microseconds.


==== connecttime

type: long

The time it takes for the TCP connection to be established for the given transaction. The precision is in microseconds.


==== loadtime

type: long

The time it takes for the content to be loaded. This is typically used for RUM (real-user-monitoring) but it can make sense in other cases as well. The precision is in microseconds.


==== domloadtime

type: long

In RUM (real-user-monitoring), the total time it takes for the DOM to be loaded. In terms of the W3 Navigation Timing API, this is the difference between `domContentLoadedEnd` and `domContentLoadedStart`.
