After following the <<configuring-packetbeat,configuration steps>> in the
Getting Started, you might want to fine tune the behavior of Packetbeat. This section
describes some common use cases for changing configuration options. 

To configure {beatname_uc}, you edit the configuration file. For rpm and deb, youâ€™ll find the default configuration file at
+/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.yml+. There's also a full example configuration file at
+/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.full.yml+ that shows all non-deprecated options. For mac and win, look in the archive
that you extracted.

See the
{libbeat}/config-file-format.html[Config File Format] section of the
_Beats Platform Reference_ for more about the structure of the config file.
