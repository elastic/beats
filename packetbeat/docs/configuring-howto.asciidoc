After following the <<configuring-packetbeat,configuration steps>> in the
Getting Started, you might want to fine tune the behavior of Packetbeat. This section
describes some common use cases for changing configuration options. 

To configure {beatname_uc}, you edit the configuration file. For rpm and deb, youâ€™ll find the configuration file at
+/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.yml+. For mac and win, look in the archive that you extracted.

For a complete description of all Packetbeat configuration options, see <<packetbeat-configuration>>.
