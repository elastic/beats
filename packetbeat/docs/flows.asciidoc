== Configuring Flows to Monitor Network Traffic

You can configure Packetbeat to collect and report statistics on network flows.
A _flow_ is a group of packets sent over the same time period that share
common properties, such as the same source and destination address and protocol.
You can use this feature to analyze network traffic over specific protocols on
your network.

For each flow, Packetbeat reports the number of packets and the total number of
bytes sent from the source to the destination. Each flow event also contains
information about the source and destination hosts, such as their IP address.
For bi-directional flows, Packetbeat reports statistics for the reverse flow.

Packetbeat collects and reports statistics up to and including the transport
layer. See <<exported-fields-flows_event>> for more info about the exported
data.

Here's an example of flow events visualized in the Flows dashboard:

To configure flows, use the `flows` option in the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file.
Flows are enabled by default.

packetbeat.flows:
  timeout: 30s
  period: 10s

See <<configuration-flows>> for more info about these configuration options.

Hereâ€™s an example of a flow information sent by Packetbeat. See
<<exported-fields-flows_event>> for a description of each field.

<1> Packetbeat sets the `final` flag to `false` to indicate that the event
contains an intermediate report about a flow that it's tracking. When the flow
completes, Packetbeat sends one last event with `final` set to `true`. If you
want to aggregate sums of traffic, you need to filter on `final:true`, or use
some other technique, so that you get only the latest update from each flow.
You can disable intermediate reports by setting `period: -1s`.
