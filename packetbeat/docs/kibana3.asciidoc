=== Viewing the Topology Diagram

We currently recommend using Kibana 4 together with Packetbeat. However, the topology panel type is not yet available for Kibana 4. This panel type is implemented in a fork of Kibana 3 that was never merged
(and never will be). When Kibana 4 adds support for plugins, the topology panel will be
re-implemented as a plugin.

This page walks you through the steps required to install the forked Kibana 3
and load the Packetbeat dashboards. You can install Kibana 3 on the same system
as Kibana 4.

==== Downloading the Kibana 3 Fork

Download and install the Kibana 3 fork by issuing the following commands:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://github.com/packetbeat/kibana/releases/download/v3.1.2-pb/kibana-3.1.2-packetbeat.tar.gz
tar -xzvf kibana-3.1.2-packetbeat.tar.gz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Kibana 3 is a pure JavaScript application running fully in the browser. It
doesn't have or need a sever-side part like most web applications. Instead,
you only needed a web server to serve the JavaScript files and the static
resources. For example, you can use Python to create a simple web server:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd kibana-3.1.2-packetbeat
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now point your browser to port 8000, and you should see the Kibana web
interface. It will probably complain that it cannot reach Elasticsearch, like
in the following screenshot:

This is because
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)] is
disabled by default in recent versions of Elasticsearch to respect the "secure
by default" philosophy. You can enable CORS by adding the following lines to the
end of the `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
http.cors.enabled: true
http.cors.allow-origin: http://localhost:8000
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that you replace `http://localhost:8000` with the URL under which you
access Kibana up to the first slash. Restart Elasticsearch:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/elasticsearch restart
----------------------------------------------------------------------

And try again to access Kibana in your browser. You should now see
Kibana's welcome page.

==== Loading Packetbeat Dashboards

To load our sample Kibana 3 dashboards, use the following commands:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-dashboards-k3-1.0.0~Beta1.tar.gz
tar xzvf packetbeat-dashboards-k3-1.0.0~Beta1.tar.gz
cd packetbeat-dashboards-k3-1.0.0~Beta1/
./load.sh localhost
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you replace `localhost` with the host of your Elasticsearch
server.
