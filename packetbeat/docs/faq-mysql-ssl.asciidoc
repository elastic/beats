=== {beatname_uc} isn't capturing MySQL performance data

You may be listening on the wrong interface or trying to capture data sent over
an encrypted connection. {beatname_uc} can only monitor MySQL traffic if it is
unencrypted. To resolve your issue:

* Make sure {beatname_uc} is configured to listen on the `lo0` interface:
+
[source,shell]
-----
packetbeat.interfaces.device: lo0
-----

* Make sure the client programs you are monitoring run `mysql` with SSL
disabled. For example:
+
[source,shell]
-----
mysql --protocol tcp --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --ssl-mode=DISABLED
-----

IMPORTANT: When SSL is disabled, the connection between the MySQL client and
server is unencrypted, which means that anyone with access to your network may
be able to inspect data sent between the client and server. If MySQL is running
in an untrusted network, it's not advisable to disable encryption.
