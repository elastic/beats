[[packetbeat-geoip]]
== Export GeoIP Information

You can use Packetbeat along with the
{ref}/geoip-processor.html[GeoIP Processor] in Elasticsearch
to export geographic location information about source IPs for incoming HTTP
requests. Then you can use this info to visualize the location of your
clients on a map in Kibana.

The geoIP processor module adds information about the geographical location of
IP addresses, based on data from the Maxmind GeoLite2 City Database. Because the
module uses a geoIP database that's installed on Elasticsearch, you don't need
to install a geoIP database on the machines running Beats.

NOTE: If your use case involves using Logstash, you can use the
{logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-geoip.html[GeoIP filter] available in Logstash
instead of using the ingest module. However, using the ingest module is the
simplest approach when you don't require the additional processing power of
Logstash.

[[packetbeat-configuring-geoip]]
=== Configuring the ingest geoIP processor module

To configure Packetbeat and the ingest geoIP processor:

1. Define an ingest node pipeline that uses a `geoip` processor to add location
info to the event. For example, you can use the Console in Kibana to create the
following pipeline:
+
--
[source,json]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PUT _ingest/pipeline/geoip-info
{
  "description": "Add geoip info",
  "processors": [
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "client.ip",
        "target_field": "client.geo",
        "ignore_failure": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//CONSOLE
--
+
This pipeline adds a `client.geo.location` field of type `geo_point` to the
event. The ID of the pipeline is `geoip-info`. `client.ip` is the output field
in Packetbeat that contains the IP address of the client. You set
`ignore_failure` to `true` so that the pipeline will continue processing events
when it encounters an event that doesn't have a `client.ip` field.
+
See
{ref}/geoip-processor.html[Using the geoip Processor in a Pipeline]
for more options.

2. In the Packetbeat config file, configure the Elasticsearch output to use the
pipeline. Specify the pipeline ID in the `pipeline` option under
`output.elasticsearch`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  pipeline: geoip-info
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Run Packetbeat, passing in the configuration file that you updated earlier.
+
[source,shell]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ./packetbeat -e -c packetbeat.yml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
The event that's sent to Elasticsearch should now include a
`client.geo.location` field.

[[packetbeat-visualizing-location]]
=== Visualizing the location of your Packetbeat clients

To visualize the location of your Packetbeat clients, you can either
<<load-kibana-dashboards,set up the example Kibana dashboards>> (if
you haven't already), or create a new {kibana-ref}/tilemap.html[coordinate map]
in Kibana and use the `client.geo.location` field as the Geohash.

TIP: If the map in the dashboard reports "no results found", and you don't see
`client.geo.location` in the list of available Geohash fields, try refreshing
the field list in Kibana. On the Management tab, select the `packetbeat-*`
index pattern, and refresh the field list to pick up any fields that were added
by the ingest geoIP processor.
