== Visualizing Packetbeat Data in Kibana

Before trying to visualize Packetbeat data in Kibana, we recommend that you load the sample dashboards {libbeat}/visualizing-data.html[described here]. Then read the topics in this
section to learn how to work with Packetbeat data in Kibana. 

=== Customize Discovery page

The sample dashboards contain `Packetbeat Search` to customize the columns in the Discovery table for the Packetbeat
transactions. In addition, it contains `Packetbeat Flows Search` to display the most important information for
the Packetbeat flows.

Note:: The search is not the default view in the Discovery page, so you need to open it explicitly in the Discovery page after
importing the sample dashboards in Kibana.
