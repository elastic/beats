=== Required Network Capabilities

Under Docker, Packetbeat runs as a non-root user, but requires some privileged
network capabilities to operate correctly. Ensure that the +NET_ADMIN+
capability is available to the container.

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN {dockerimage}
----

=== Capturing Traffic from the Host System

By default, Docker networking will connect the Packetbeat container to an
isolated virtual network, with a limited view of network traffic. You may wish
to connect the container directly to the host network in order to see traffic
destined for, and originating from, the host system. With +docker run+, this can
be achieved by specifying +--network=host+.

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --network=host {dockerimage}
----

NOTE: On Windows and MacOS, specifying +--network=host+ will bind the
container's network interface to the virtual interface of Docker's embedded
Linux virtual machine, not to the physical interface of the host system.
