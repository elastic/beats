This section contains detailed information about the available network packet
log processing modules contained in {beatname_uc}.

{beatname_uc} modules are implemented using Elasticsearch Ingest Node pipelines.
The events receive their transformations within Elasticsearch. All events are
sent through {beatname_uc}'s "routing" pipeline that routes events to specific
module pipelines based on their network protocol.

{beatname_uc}'s default config file contains the option to send all events to
the routing pipeline. If you remove this option then the module processing
will not be applied.

The general goal of each module is to transform events by renaming fields to
comply with the {ecs-ref}/index.html[Elastic Common Schema] (ECS). The modules
may also apply additional categorization, tagging, and parsing as necessary.
about how to configure the language in `packetbeat`, refer to <<configuration-packetbeat-options>>.

=== Setup of Ingest Node pipelines

{beatname_uc}'s Ingest Node pipelines must be installed to Elasticsearch if you
want to apply the module processing to events. The simplest way to get started
is to use the Elasticsearch output and {beatname_uc} will automatically install
the pipelines when it first connects to Elasticsearch.
