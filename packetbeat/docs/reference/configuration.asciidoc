== Configuration Options

Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've completed the <<configuring-packetbeat,configuration steps>> in the Getting Started.

The Packetbeat configuration file uses http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax.
The configuration options are described in the following sections. After changing
configuration settings, you need to restart Packetbeat to pick up the changes.

* <<configuration-interfaces>>
* <<configuration-flows>>
* <<configuration-protocols>>
* <<configuration-processes>>
* <<elasticsearch-output>>
* <<logstash-output>>
* <<redis-output>>
* <<kafka-output>>
* <<file-output>>
* <<console-output>>
* <<configuration-shipper>>
* <<configuration-logging>>
* <<configuration-run-options>>

NOTE: Packetbeat maintains a real-time topology map of all the servers in your network.
