== Configuration Options (Reference)

Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've completed the <<configuring-packetbeat,configuration steps>> in the Getting Started.

The {beatname_uc} configuration file, +{beatname_lc}.yml+, uses http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax.
The configuration options are described in the following sections. After changing
configuration settings, you need to restart {beatname_uc} to pick up the changes.

* <<configuration-interfaces>>
* <<configuration-flows>>
* <<configuration-protocols>>
* <<configuration-processes>>
* <<configuration-general>>
* <<configuration-processors>>
* <<elasticsearch-output>>
* <<logstash-output>>
* <<kafka-output>>
* <<redis-output>>
* <<file-output>>
* <<console-output>>
* <<configuration-output-ssl>>
* <<configuration-path>>
* <<configuration-logging>>
