== Configuration Options

Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've completed the <<configuring-packetbeat,configuration steps>> in the Getting Started.

The configuration options are described in the following sections. After changing
configuration settings, you need to restart Packetbeat to pick up the changes.

* <<configuration-interfaces>>

* <<configuration-protocols>>
* <<configuration-processes>>
* <<elasticsearch-output>>
* <<logstash-output>>
