== Load ingest pipelines

{beatname_uc} modules are implemented using {es} ingest node
pipelines.  The events receive their transformations within
{es}.  The ingest node pipelines must be loaded
into {es}.  This can happen one of several ways.

=== On connection to {es}

{beatname_uc} will send ingest pipelines automatically to {es} if the
{es} output is enabled.

Make sure the user specified in +{beatname_lc}.yml+ is
<<privileges-to-setup-beats,authorized to set up {beatname_uc}>>.

If {beatname_uc} is sending events to {ls} or another output you need
to load the ingest pipelines with the `setup` command or manually.

[id="{beatname_lc}-load-pipeline-manual"]
[float]
=== Manually install pipelines

Pipelines can be loaded them into {es} with the `_ingest/pipeline` REST API
call. The user making the REST API call will need to have the `ingest_admin`
role assigned to them.
