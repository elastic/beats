      description: >
         MongoDB-specific event fields. These fields mirror closely
         the fields for the MongoDB wire protocol. The higher level fields
         (for example, `query` and `resource`) apply to MongoDB events as well.
      fields:
        - name: mongodb.error
          description: >
            If the MongoDB request has resulted in an error, this field contains the
            error message returned by the server.
        - name: mongodb.fullCollectionName
          description: >
            The full collection name.
            The full collection name is the concatenation of the database name with the collection name,
            using a dot (.) for the concatenation.
            For example, for the database foo and the collection bar, the full collection name is foo.bar.

          description: >
            A JSON document that represents the query.
            The query will contain one or more elements, all of which must match for a document
            to be included in the result set.
            Possible elements include $query, $orderby, $hint, $explain, and $snapshot.
        - name: mongodb.returnFieldsSelector
          description: >
            A JSON document that limits the fields in the returned documents.

    - name: bytes_in
      description: >

      type: int

    - name: dnstime
      type: int
      description: >
        The time it takes to query the name server for a given request.
        This is typically used for RUM (real-user-monitoring) but can
        also have values for server-to-server communication when DNS
        is used for service discovery.
        The precision is in microseconds.

    - name: connecttime
      type: int
      description: >
        The time it takes for the TCP connection to be established for
        the given transaction.

      type: int
      description: >
        The time it takes for the content to be loaded. This is typically
        used for RUM (real-user-monitoring) but it can make sense in other
        cases as well.
        The precision is in microseconds.

      type: int
      description: >
        In RUM (real-user-monitoring), the total time it takes for the

        the difference between `domContentLoadedEnd` and
        `domContentLoadedStart`.
