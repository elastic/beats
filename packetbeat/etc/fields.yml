         MongoDB-specific event fields. These fields mirror closely
         the fields for the MongoDB wire protocol. The higher level fields
         (for example, `query` and `resource`) apply to MongoDB events as well.
      fields:
        - name: error
          description: >
            If the MongoDB request has resulted in an error, this field contains the
            error message returned by the server.
        - name: fullCollectionName
          description: >
            The full collection name.
            The full collection name is the concatenation of the database name with the collection name,
            using a dot (.) for the concatenation.
            For example, for the database foo and the collection bar, the full collection name is foo.bar.

        - name: query
          description: >
            A JSON document that represents the query.
            The query will contain one or more elements, all of which must match for a document
            to be included in the result set.
            Possible elements include $query, $orderby, $hint, $explain, and $snapshot.
        - name: returnFieldsSelector
          description: >
            A JSON document that limits the fields in the returned documents.
            The returnFieldsSelector contains one or more elements, each of which is the name of a field that should be returned,
            and the integer value 1.
        - name: selector
          description: >
            A BSON document that specifies the query for selecting the document to update or delete.
        - name: update
          description: >
            A BSON document that specifies the update to be performed.
            For information on specifying updates, see the Update Operations documentation from the MongoDB Manual.
        - name: cursorId
          description: >
            The cursor identifier returned in the OP_REPLY. This must be the value that was returned from the database.

raw:
  type: group
  description: These fields contain the raw transaction data.
  fields:
    - name: request
      index: analyzed
      description: >
        For text protocols, this is the request as seen on the wire
        (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our
        representation of the request.

    - name: response
      index: analyzed
      description: >
        For text protocols, this is the response as seen on the wire
        (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our
        representation of the request.

trans_measurements:
  type: group
  description: >
    These fields contain measurements related to the transaction.
  fields:
    - name: responsetime
      description: >
        The wall clock time it took to complete the transaction.
        The precision is in milliseconds.
      type: int

    - name: cpu_time
      description: The CPU time it took to complete the transaction.
      type: int

    - name: bytes_in
      description: >
        The number of bytes of the request. Note that this size is
        the application layer message length, without the length of the IP or
        TCP headers.
      type: int

    - name: bytes_out
      description: >
        The number of bytes of the response. Note that this size is
        the application layer message length, without the length of the IP or
        TCP headers.
      type: int

    - name: dnstime
      type: int
      description: >
        The time it takes to query the name server for a given request.
        This is typically used for RUM (real-user-monitoring) but can
        also have values for server-to-server communication when DNS
        is used for service discovery.
        The precision is in microseconds.

    - name: connecttime
      type: int
      description: >
        The time it takes for the TCP connection to be established for
        the given transaction.
        The precision is in microseconds.

    - name: loadtime
      type: int
      description: >
        The time it takes for the content to be loaded. This is typically
        used for RUM (real-user-monitoring) but it can make sense in other
        cases as well.
        The precision is in microseconds.

    - name: domloadtime
      type: int
      description: >
        In RUM (real-user-monitoring), the total time it takes for the
        DOM to be loaded. In terms of the W3 Navigation Timing API, this is
        the difference between `domContentLoadedEnd` and
        `domContentLoadedStart`.
