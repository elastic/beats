###################### Packetbeat Configuration Example #######################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see packetbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/index.html

#============================== Network device ================================

# Select the network interface to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
packetbeat.interfaces.device: any

# Packetbeat supports three sniffer types:
# * pcap, which uses the libpcap library and works on most platforms, but it's
# not the fastest option.
# * af_packet, which uses memory-mapped sniffing. This option is faster than
# libpcap and doesn't require a kernel module, but it's Linux-specific.
#packetbeat.interfaces.type: pcap

# The maximum size of the packets to capture. The default is 65535, which is
# large enough for almost all networks and interface types. If you sniff on a
# physical network interface, the optimal setting is the MTU size. On virtual
# interfaces, however, it's safer to accept the default value.
#packetbeat.interfaces.snaplen: 65535

# The maximum size of the shared memory buffer to use between the kernel and
# user space. A bigger buffer usually results in lower CPU usage, but consumes
# more memory. This setting is only available for the af_packet sniffer type.
# The default is 30 MB.
#packetbeat.interfaces.buffer_size_mb: 30

# Packetbeat automatically generates a BPF for capturing only the traffic on
# ports where it expects to find known protocols. Use this settings to tell
# Packetbeat to generate a BPF filter that accepts VLAN tags.
#packetbeat.interfaces.with_vlans: true

# Use this setting to override the automatically generated BPF filter.
#packetbeat.interfaces.bpf_filter:

# With `auto_promisc_mode` Packetbeat puts interface in promiscuous mode automatically on startup.
# This option does not work with `any` interface device.
# The default option is false and requires manual set-up of promiscuous mode.
# Warning: under some circumstances (e.g beat crash) promiscuous mode
# can stay enabled even after beat is shut down.
#packetbeat.interfaces.auto_promisc_mode: true

#================================== Flows =====================================

#================================ Processors ===================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#- include_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu"]
#- drop_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#- drop_event:
#    when:
#       equals:
#           http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#- rename:
#    fields:
#       - from: "a"
#         to: "b"
#
# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#
#processors:
#- dissect:
#    tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#    field: "message"
#    target_prefix: "dissect"
#
# The following example enriches each event with metadata from the cloud
# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#- add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#- add_locale:
#    format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata:
#    host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
#    match_fields: ["system.process.cgroup.id"]
#    match_pids: ["process.pid", "process.ppid"]
#    match_source: true
#    match_source_index: 4
#    match_short_id: false
#    cleanup_timeout: 60
#    labels.dedot: false
#    # To connect to Docker over TLS you must specify a client and CA certificate.
#    #ssl:

#    #  key:                   "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:
#- add_host_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#

#============================== Setup ILM =====================================

# Configure index lifecycle management (ILM). These settings create a write
# alias and add additional settings to the index template. When ILM is enabled,
# output.elasticsearch.index is ignored, and the write alias is used to set the
# index name.

# Enable ILM support. Valid values are true, false, and auto. When set to auto
# (the default), the Beat uses index lifecycle management when it connects to a
# cluster that supports ILM; otherwise, it creates daily indices.
#setup.ilm.enabled: auto

# Set the prefix used in the index lifecycle write alias name. The default alias
# name is 'packetbeat-%{[agent.version]}'.

# to load your own lifecycle policy.

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.

# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
#monitoring.elasticsearch:

#================================ HTTP Endpoint ======================================
