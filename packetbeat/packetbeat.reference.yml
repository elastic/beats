###################### Packetbeat Configuration Example #######################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see packetbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/index.html

#============================== Network device ================================

# Select the network interface to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
packetbeat.interfaces.device: any

# Packetbeat supports three sniffer types:
# * pcap, which uses the libpcap library and works on most platforms, but it's
# not the fastest option.
# * af_packet, which uses memory-mapped sniffing. This option is faster than
# libpcap and doesn't require a kernel module, but it's Linux-specific.
#packetbeat.interfaces.type: pcap

# The maximum size of the packets to capture. The default is 65535, which is
# large enough for almost all networks and interface types. If you sniff on a
# physical network interface, the optimal setting is the MTU size. On virtual
# interfaces, however, it's safer to accept the default value.
#packetbeat.interfaces.snaplen: 65535

# The maximum size of the shared memory buffer to use between the kernel and
# user space. A bigger buffer usually results in lower CPU usage, but consumes
# more memory. This setting is only available for the af_packet sniffer type.
# The default is 30 MB.
#packetbeat.interfaces.buffer_size_mb: 30

# Packetbeat automatically generates a BPF for capturing only the traffic on
# ports where it expects to find known protocols. Use this settings to tell
# Packetbeat to generate a BPF filter that accepts VLAN tags.
#packetbeat.interfaces.with_vlans: true

# Use this setting to override the automatically generated BPF filter.
#packetbeat.interfaces.bpf_filter:

#================================== Flows =====================================

packetbeat.flows:
  # Enable Network flows. Default: true
  #enabled: true

  # Set network flow timeout. Flow is killed if no packet is received before being
  # timed out.
  timeout: 30s

  # Configure reporting period. If set to -1, only killed flows will be reported
  period: 10s

#================================ Processors ===================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#- include_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu"]
#- drop_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#- drop_event:
#    when:
#       equals:
#           http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#- rename:
#    fields:
#       - from: "a"
#         to: "b"
#
# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#
#processors:
#- dissect:
#    tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#    field: "message"
#    target_prefix: "dissect"
#
# The following example enriches each event with metadata from the cloud
# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#- add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#- add_locale:
#    format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:

#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:
#- add_host_metadata:
#   netinfo.enabled: false
#
# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#
#processors:
#- add_process_metadata:
#    match_pids: ["system.process.ppid"]
#    target: system.process.parent
#
# The following example decodes fields containing JSON strings
# and replaces the strings with valid JSON objects.

#
# The following example copies the value of message to message_copied
#
#processors:

#    fields:
#        - from: message
#          to: message_copied

#============================== X-Pack Monitoring ===============================

# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.

#================================ HTTP Endpoint ======================================
# Each beat can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
