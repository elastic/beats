  description: >
    MongoDB-specific event fields. These fields mirror closely
    the fields for the MongoDB wire protocol. The higher level fields
    (for example, `query` and `resource`) apply to MongoDB events as well.
  fields:
    - name: mongodb
      type: group
      fields:
        - name: error
          description: >
            If the MongoDB request has resulted in an error, this field contains the
            error message returned by the server.
        - name: fullCollectionName
          description: >
            The full collection name.
            The full collection name is the concatenation of the database name with the collection name,
            using a dot (.) for the concatenation.
            For example, for the database foo and the collection bar, the full collection name is foo.bar.
        - name: numberToSkip
          type: long
          description: >
            Sets the number of documents to omit - starting from the first document in the resulting dataset -
            when returning the result of the query.
        - name: numberToReturn
          type: long
          description: >
            The requested maximum number of documents to be returned.
        - name: numberReturned
          type: long
          description: >
            The number of documents in the reply.
        - name: startingFrom
          description: >
            Where in the cursor this reply is starting.
        - name: query
          description: >
            A JSON document that represents the query.
            The query will contain one or more elements, all of which must match for a document
            to be included in the result set.
            Possible elements include $query, $orderby, $hint, $explain, and $snapshot.
        - name: returnFieldsSelector
          description: >
            A JSON document that limits the fields in the returned documents.
            The returnFieldsSelector contains one or more elements, each of which is the name of a field that should be returned,
            and the integer value 1.
        - name: selector
          description: >
            A BSON document that specifies the query for selecting the document to update or delete.
        - name: update
          description: >
            A BSON document that specifies the update to be performed.
            For information on specifying updates, see the Update Operations documentation from the MongoDB Manual.
        - name: cursorId
          description: >
            The cursor identifier returned in the OP_REPLY. This must be the value that was returned from the database.
