    MongoDB-specific event fields. These fields mirror closely
    the fields for the MongoDB wire protocol. The higher level fields
    (for example, `query` and `resource`) apply to MongoDB events as well.
  fields:
    - name: mongodb
      type: group
      fields:
        - name: error
          description: >
            If the MongoDB request has resulted in an error, this field contains the
            error message returned by the server.
        - name: fullCollectionName
          description: >
            The full collection name.
            The full collection name is the concatenation of the database name with the collection name,
            using a dot (.) for the concatenation.
            For example, for the database foo and the collection bar, the full collection name is foo.bar.

        - name: returnFieldsSelector
          description: >
            A JSON document that limits the fields in the returned documents.
