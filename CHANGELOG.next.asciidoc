=== Beats version HEAD

==== Breaking changes

*Affecting all Beats*

- Fix FQDN being lowercased when used as `host.hostname` {issue}39993[39993]
- Beats won't log start up information when running under the Elastic Agent {40390}40390[40390]
- Filebeat now needs `dup3`, `faccessat2`, `prctl` and `setrlimit` syscalls to run the journald input. If this input is not being used, the syscalls are not needed. All Beats have those syscalls allowed now because the default seccomp policy is global to all Beats. {pull}40061[40061]
- Beats will rate limit the logs about errors when indexing events on Elasticsearch, logging a summary every 10s. The logs sent to the event log is unchanged. {issue}40157[40157]
- Drop support for Debian 10 and upgrade statically linked glibc from 2.28 to 2.31 {pull}41402[41402]
- Fix metrics not being ingested, due to "Limit of total fields [10000] has been exceeded while adding new fields [...]". The total fields limit has been increased to 12500. No significant performance impact on Elasticsearch is anticipated. {pull}41640[41640]
- Fix templates and docs to use correct `--` version of command line arguments. {issue}42038[42038] {pull}42060[42060]
- removed support for a single `-` to precede multi-letter command line arguments.  Use `--` instead. {issue}42117[42117] {pull}42209[42209]

*Auditbeat*


*Filebeat*

- Convert netflow input to API v2 and disable event normalisation {pull}37901[37901]
- Removed deprecated Squid from Beats. See <<migrate-from-deprecated-module>> for migration options. {pull}38037[38037]
- Removed deprecated Sonicwall from Beats. Use the https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/sonicwall[SonicWall Firewall] Elastic integration instead. {pull}38037[38037]
- Removed deprecated Radware from Beats. See <<migrate-from-deprecated-module>> for migration options. {pull}38037[38037]
- Removed deprecated Netscout from Beats. See <<migrate-from-deprecated-module>> for migration options. {pull}38037[38037]
- Removed deprecated Juniper Netscreen from Beats. See <<migrate-from-deprecated-module>> for migration options. {pull}38037[38037]
- Removed deprecated Impreva from Beats. See <<migrate-from-deprecated-module>> for migration options. {pull}38037[38037]
- Removed deprecated Cylance from Beats. See <<migrate-from-deprecated-module>> for migration options. {pull}38037[38037]
- Removed deprecated Bluecoat from Beats. See <<migrate-from-deprecated-module>> for migration options. {pull}38037[38037]
- Introduce input/netmetrics and refactor netflow input metrics {pull}38055[38055]
- Redis: Added replication role as a field to submitted slowlogs
- Change log.file.path field in awscloudwatch input to nested object. {pull}41099[41099]

- Remove deprecated awscloudwatch field from Filebeat. {pull}41089[41089]
- The performance of ingesting SQS data with the S3 input has improved by up to 60x for queues with many small events. `max_number_of_messages` config for SQS mode is now ignored, as the new design no longer needs a manual cap on messages. Instead, use `number_of_workers` to scale ingestion rate in both S3 and SQS modes. The increased efficiency may increase network bandwidth consumption, which can be throttled by lowering `number_of_workers`. It may also increase number of events stored in memory, which can be throttled by lowering the configured size of the internal queue. {pull}40699[40699]
- Fixes filestream logging the error "filestream input with ID 'ID' already exists, this will lead to data duplication[...]" on Kubernetes when using autodiscover. {pull}41585[41585]
- Add kafka compression support for ZSTD.
- Filebeat fails to start if there is any input with a duplicated ID. It logs the duplicated IDs and the offending inputs configurations. {pull}41731[41731]
- Filestream inputs with duplicated IDs will fail to start. An error is logged showing the ID and the full input configuration. {issue}41938[41938] {pull}41954[41954]
- Filestream inputs can define `allow_deprecated_id_duplication: true` to run keep the previous behaviour of running inputs with duplicated IDs. {issue}41938[41938] {pull}41954[41954]
- The Filestream input only starts to ingest a file when it is >= 1024 bytes in size. This happens because the fingerprint` is the default file identity now. To restore the previous behaviour, set `file_identity.native: ~` and `prospector.scanner.fingerprint.enabled: false` {issue}40197[40197] {pull}41762[41762]
- Filebeat fails to start when its configuration contains usage of the deprecated `log` or `container` inputs. However, they can still be using while setting `allow_deprecated_use: true` in their configuration {pull}42295[42295]
- The fields produced by the Journald input are updated to better match ECS. Renamed fields:
Dropped fields: `syslog.priority` and `syslog.facility` while keeping their duplicated equivalent:
`log.syslog.priority`,`log.syslog.facility.code`. Renamed fields: `syslog.identifier` -> `log.syslog.appname`,
`syslog.pid` -> `log.syslog.procid`. `container.id_truncated` is dropped because the full container ID is
already present as `container.id` and `container.log.tag` is dropped because it is already present as
`log.syslog.appname`. The field `container.partial` is replaced by the tag `partial_message` if it was `true`,
otherwise no tag is added. {issue}42208[42208] {pull}42403[42403]
