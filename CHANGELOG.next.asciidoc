=== Beats version HEAD
https://github.com/elastic/beats/compare/v8.8.1\...main[Check the HEAD diff]

==== Breaking changes

*Affecting all Beats*

- Fix FQDN being lowercased when used as `host.hostname` {issue}39993[39993]
- Beats won't log start up information when running under the Elastic Agent {40390}40390[40390]
- Filebeat now needs `dup3`, `faccessat2`, `prctl` and `setrlimit` syscalls to run the journald input. If this input is not being used, the syscalls are not needed. All Beats have those syscalls allowed now because the default seccomp policy is global to all Beats. {pull}40061[40061]
- Beats will rate limit the logs about errors when indexing events on Elasticsearch, logging a summary every 10s. The logs sent to the event log is unchanged. {issue}40157[40157]
