==== Breaking changes

*Affecting all Beats*
- The Elasticsearch output now enables compression by default. This decreases network data usage by an average of 70-80%, in exchange for 20-25% increased CPU use and ~10% increased ingestion time. The previous default can be restored by setting the flag `compression_level: 0` under `output.elasticsearch`. {pull}36681[36681]
