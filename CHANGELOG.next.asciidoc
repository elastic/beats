==== Breaking changes

*Affecting all Beats*

- Fix FQDN being lowercased when used as `host.hostname` {issue}39993[39993]
- Beats won't log start up information when running under the Elastic Agent {40390}40390[40390]
- Filebeat now needs `dup3`, `faccessat2`, `prctl` and `setrlimit` syscalls to run the journald input. If this input is not being used, the syscalls are not needed. All Beats have those syscalls allowed now because the default seccomp policy is global to all Beats. {pull}40061[40061]
- Beats will rate limit the logs about errors when indexing events on Elasticsearch, logging a summary every 10s. The logs sent to the event log is unchanged. {issue}40157[40157]
- Drop support for Debian 10 and upgrade statically linked glibc from 2.28 to 2.31 {pull}41402[41402]

- Removed deprecated Sonicwall from Beats. Use the https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/sonicwall[SonicWall Firewall] Elastic integration instead. {pull}38037[38037]
- Removed deprecated Radware from Beats. See <<migrate-from-deprecated-module>> for migration options. {pull}38037[38037]
- Removed deprecated Netscout from Beats. See <<migrate-from-deprecated-module>> for migration options. {pull}38037[38037]

- Introduce input/netmetrics and refactor netflow input metrics {pull}38055[38055]
- Update Salesforce module to use new Salesforce input. {pull}37509[37509]
- Tag events that come from a filestream in "take over" mode. {pull}39828[39828]
- Fix high IO and handling of a corrupted registry log file. {pull}35893[35893]
- Enable file ingestion to report detailed status to Elastic Agent {pull}40075[40075]
- Filebeat, when running with Elastic-Agent, reports status for Filestream input. {pull}40121[40121]
- Implement Elastic Agent status and health reporting for Winlog Filebeat input. {pull}40163[40163]
- Fix filestream's registry GC: registry entries will never be removed if clean_inactive is set to "-1". {pull}40258[40258]
- Added `ignore_empty_values` flag in `decode_cef` Filebeat processor. {pull}40268[40268]
- Added support for hyphens in extension keys in `decode_cef` Filebeat processor. {pull}40427[40427]
- Journald: removed configuration options `include_matches.or`, `include_matches.and`, `backoff`, `max_backoff`, `cursor_seek_fallback`. {pull}40061[40061]
- Journald: `include_matches.match` now behaves in the same way as matchers in `journalctl`. Users should carefully update their input configuration. {pull}40061[40061]
- Journald: `seek` and `since` behaviour have been simplified, if there is a cursor (state) `seek` and `since` are ignored and the cursor is used. {pull}40061[40061]
- Redis: Added replication role as a field to submitted slowlogs
- Added `container.image.name` to `journald` Filebeat input's Docker-specific translated fields. {pull}40450[40450]
- Change log.file.path field in awscloudwatch input to nested object. {pull}41099[41099]
- Remove deprecated awscloudwatch field from Filebeat. {pull}41089[41089]
- The performance of ingesting SQS data with the S3 input has improved by up to 60x for queues with many small events. `max_number_of_messages` config for SQS mode is now ignored, as the new design no longer needs a manual cap on messages. Instead, use `number_of_workers` to scale ingestion rate in both S3 and SQS modes. The increased efficiency may increase network bandwidth consumption, which can be throttled by lowering `number_of_workers`. It may also increase number of events stored in memory, which can be throttled by lowering the configured size of the internal queue. {pull}40699[40699]

- Add kafka compression support for ZSTD.
