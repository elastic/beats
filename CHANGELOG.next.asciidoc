=== Beats version HEAD
https://github.com/elastic/beats/compare/v7.0.0-alpha2...master[Check the HEAD diff]

==== Breaking changes

*Affecting all Beats*

- Update to Golang 1.12.1. {pull}11330[11330]
- By default, all Beats-created files and folders will have a umask of 0027 (on POSIX systems). {pull}14119[14119]

*Auditbeat*


*Filebeat*


*Heartbeat*

- Removed the `add_host_metadata` and `add_cloud_metadata` processors from the default config. These don't fit well with ECS for Heartbeat and were rarely used.
- Fixed/altered redirect behavior. `max_redirects` now defaults to 0 (no redirects). Following redirects now works across hosts, but some timing fields will not be reported. {pull}14125[14125]
- Removed `host.name` field that should never have been included. Heartbeat uses `observer.*` fields instead. {pull}14140[14140]
- JSON/Regex checks against HTTP bodies will only consider the first 100MiB of the HTTP body to prevent excessive memory usage. {pull}14223[pull]
