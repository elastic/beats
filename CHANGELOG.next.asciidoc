- Remove monitor generator script that was rarely used. {pull}9648[9648]
- monitor IDs are now configurable. Auto generated monitor IDs now use a different formula based on a hash of their config values. If you wish to have continuity with the old format of monitor IDs you'll need to set the `id` property explicitly. {pull}9697[9697]
- A number of fields have been aliased to their relevant counterparts in the `url.*` field. Existing visualizations should mostly work. The fields that have been moved are `monitor.scheme -> url.scheme`, `monitor.host -> url.domain`, `resolve.host -> url.domain`, `http.url -> url.full`,  `tcp.port -> url.port`. In addition to these moves the new fields `url.username`, `url.password`, `url.path`, and `url.query` are now present. It should be noted that the `url.password` field does not contain actual password values, but rather the text `<hidden>` {pull}9570[9570].
