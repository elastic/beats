=== Beats version HEAD
https://github.com/elastic/beats/compare/v8.8.1\...main[Check the HEAD diff]

==== Breaking changes

*Affecting all Beats*

- Upgrade to Go 1.21.7. Removes support for Windows 8.1. See https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.21#windows. {pull}37913[37913]
- add_cloud_metadata processor: `huawei` provider is now treated as `openstack`. Huawei cloud runs on OpenStack
platform, and when viewed from a metadata API standpoint, it is impossible to differentiate it from OpenStack. If you
know that your deployments run on Huawei Cloud exclusively, and you wish to have `cloud.provider` value as `huawei`,
you can achieve this by overwriting the value using an `add_fields` processor. {pull}35184[35184]
- In managed mode, Beats running under Elastic Agent will report the package
version of Elastic Agent as their own version. This includes all additional
fields added to events containing the Beats version. {pull}37553[37553]
- The behavior of `queue.mem.flush.min_events` has been simplified. It now serves as a simple maximum on the size of all event batches. There are no longer performance implications in its relationship to `bulk_max_size`. {pull}37795[37795]

*Auditbeat*

- Add opt-in `KProbes` backend for file_integrity module. {pull}37796[37796]
