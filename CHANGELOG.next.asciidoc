==== Breaking changes

*Affecting all Beats*

- add_cloud_metadata processor: `huawei` provider is now treated as `openstack`. Huawei cloud runs on OpenStack
platform, and when viewed from a metadata API standpoint, it is impossible to differentiate it from OpenStack. If you
know that your deployments run on Huawei Cloud exclusively, and you wish to have `cloud.provider` value as `huawei`,
you can achieve this by overwriting the value using an `add_fields` processor. {pull}35184[35184]
