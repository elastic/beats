=== Beats version HEAD
https://github.com/elastic/beats/compare/v7.0.0-alpha2...master[Check the HEAD diff]

==== Breaking changes

*Affecting all Beats*

- The Elasticsearch output now enables compression by default. This decreases network data usage by an average of 70-80%, in exchange for 20-25% increased CPU use and ~10% increased ingestion time. The previous default can be restored by setting the flag `compression_level: 0` under `output.elasticsearch`. {pull}36681[36681]
- Elastic-agent-autodiscover library updated to version 0.6.4, disabling metadata for deployment and cronjob. Pods that will be created from deployments or cronjobs will not have the extra metadata field for kubernetes.deployment or kubernetes.cronjob, respectively. {pull}36877[36877]
- Defaults are changing for some options in the queue and Elasticsearch output, to improve typical performance based on current benchmark data. All changes can be overridden by setting them explicitly in the beat configuration. {pull}36990[36990] The changes are:
  - `queue.mem.events` is changing from `4096` to `3200`.
  - `queue.mem.flush.min_events` is changing from `2048` to `1600`.
  - `queue.mem.flush.timeout` is changing from `1s` to `10s`.
  - `output.elasticsearch.bulk_max_size` is changing from `50` to `1600`.
  - `output.elasticsearch.idle_connection_timeout` is changing from `60s` to `3s`.
- Avoid logging fields values when handling Elasticsearch output errors except at the debug log level. The debug log level must now be used to see detailed errors, for example mapping errors and their cause. {pull}37229[37229]
