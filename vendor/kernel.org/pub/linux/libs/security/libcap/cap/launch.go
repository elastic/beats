// will ensure that their effects are limited to the runtime of this
// individual function invocation. Warning: executing non-cap.*()
// syscall functions may corrupt the state of the program runtime and

// the one that ultimately calls fork to complete the launch of a path
// specified executable. Any returned error value of said function
// will terminate the launch process.
//
// A nil fn causes there to be no callback function invoked during a
// Launch() sequence - it will remove any pre-existing callback.
//
// If the non-nil fn requires any effective capabilities in order to
// run, they can be raised prior to calling .Launch() or inside the
// callback function itself.
//
// If the specified callback fn should call any "cap" package
// functions that change privilege state, these calls will only affect
// the launch goroutine itself. While the launch is in progress, other
// (non-launch) goroutines will block if they attempt to change
// privilege state. These routines will unblock once there are no
// in-flight launches.
//
// Note, the first argument provided to the callback function is the
// *syscall.ProcAttr value to be used when a process launch is taking
// place. A non-nil structure pointer can be modified by the callback
// to enhance the launch. For example, the .Files field can be
// overridden to affect how the launched process' stdin/out/err are
// handled.
