ZLint

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/zmap/zlint)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/zmap/zlint)

ZLint is a X.509 certificate linter written in Go that checks for consistency
with [RFC 5280](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt) and the CA/Browser Forum
Baseline Requirements
([v.1.4.8](https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/CA-Browser-Forum-BR-1.4.8.pdf)).

A detailed list of BR coverage can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ywp0op9mkTaggigpdF2YMTubepowJ50KQBhc_b00e-Y.

Requirements
------------

ZLint requires [Go 1.12.x or newer](https://golang.org/doc/install) be
installed. The command line setup instructions assume the `go` command is in
your `$PATH`.

Versioning
----------

ZLint aims to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The addition of
new lints will generally result in a MINOR version revision. Since downstream
projects depend on lint results and names for policy decisions changes of this
nature will result in MAJOR version revision.

Command Line Usage
------------------

ZLint can be used on the command-line through a simple bundled executable
_ZLint_ as well as through
[ZCertificate](https://github.com/zmap/zcertificate), a more full-fledged
command-line certificate parser that links against ZLint.

Example ZLint CLI usage:

	go get github.com/zmap/zlint/cmd/zlint
	zlint mycert.pem


Library Usage
-------------

ZLint can also be used as a library:

```go
import (
	"github.com/zmap/zcrypto/x509"
	"github.com/zmap/zlint"
)

parsed, err := x509.ParseCertificate(raw)
if err != nil {
	// The certificate could not be parsed. Either error or halt.
	log.Fatalf("could not parse certificate: %s", err)
}
zlintResultSet := zlint.LintCertificate(parsed)
```


See https://github.com/zmap/zlint/blob/master/cmd/zlint/main.go for an example.


Adding New Lints
----------------

**Generating Lint Scaffolding.** The scaffolding for a new lints can be created
by running `./newLint.sh <lint_name> <structName>`. Lint names are generally of
the form `e_subject_common_name_not_from_san` where the first letter is one of:
`e`, `w`, or `n` (error, warning, or notice respectively). Struct names
following Go conventions, e.g., `subjectCommonNameNotFromSAN`. Example:
`./newLint.sh e_subject_common_name_not_from_san subjectCommonNameNotFromSAN`.
This will generate a new lint in the `lints` directory with the necessary
fields filled out.

**Choosing a Lint Result Level.** When choosing what `lints.LintStatus` your new
lint should return (e.g. `Notice`,`Warn`, `Error`, or `Fatal`) the following
general guidance may help. `Error` should be used for clear violations of RFC/BR
`MUST` or `MUST NOT` requirements and include strong citations. `Warn` should be
used for violations of RFC/BR `SHOULD` or `SHOULD NOT` requirements and again
should include strong citations. `Notice` should be used for more general "FYI"
statements that violate non-codified community standards or for cases where
citations are unclear. Lastly `Fatal` should be used when there is an
unresolvable error in `zlint`, `zcrypto` or some other part of the certificate
processing.

**Scoping a Lint.** Lints are executed in three steps. First, the ZLint
framework determines whether a certificate falls within the scope of a given
lint by calling `CheckApplies`. This is often used to scope lints to only check
subscriber, intermediate CA, or root CAs. This function commonly calls one of a
select number of helper functions: `IsCA`, `IsSubscriber`, `IsExtInCert`, or
`DNSNamesExist`. Example:

```go
func (l *caCRLSignNotSet) CheckApplies(c *x509.Certificate) bool {
	return c.IsCA && util.IsExtInCert(c, util.KeyUsageOID)
}
```

Next, the framework determines whether the certificate was issued after the
effective date of a Lint by checking whether the certificate was issued prior
to the lint's `EffectiveDate`. You'll also need to fill out the source and
description of what the lint is checking. We encourage you to copy text
directly from the BR or RFC here. Example:

```go
func init() {
	RegisterLint(&Lint{
		Name:          "e_ca_country_name_missing",
		Description:   "Root and Subordinate CA certificates MUST have a countryName present in subject information",
		Citation:      "BRs: 7.1.2.1",
		EffectiveDate: util.CABEffectiveDate,
		Test:          &caCountryNameMissing{},
	})
}
```

The meat of the lint is contained within the `RunTest` function, which is
passed `x509.Certificate`. **Note:** This is an X.509 object from
[ZCrypto](https://github.com/zmap/zcrypto) not the Go standard library. Lints
should perform their described test and then return a `ResultStruct` that
contains a Result and optionally a `Details` string, e.g.,
`ResultStruct{Result: Pass}`. If you encounter a situation in which you
typically would return a Go `error` object, instead return
`ResultStruct{Result: Fatal}`.

Example:

```go
func (l *caCRLSignNotSet) RunTest(c *x509.Certificate) *ResultStruct {
	if c.KeyUsage&x509.KeyUsageCRLSign != 0 {
		return &ResultStruct{Result: Pass}
	}
	return &ResultStruct{Result: Error}
}
```

**Creating Tests.** Every lint should also have two corresponding tests for a
success and failure condition. We have typically generated test certificates
using Go (see https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/#CreateCertificate for
details), but OpenSSL could also be used. Test certificates should be placed in
`testlint/testCerts` and called from the test file created by `newLint.sh`.
Prepend the PEM with the output of `openssl x509 -text`.

Example:

```go
func TestBasicConstNotCritical(t *testing.T) {
	// Only need to change these two values and the lint name
	inputPath := "../testlint/testCerts/caBasicConstNotCrit.pem"
	expected := Error
	out, _ := Lints["e_basic_constraints_not_critical"].ExecuteTest(ReadCertificate(inputPath))
	if out.Result != expected {
		t.Errorf("%s: expected %s, got %s", inputPath, expected, out.Status)
	}
}

```

Updating the TLD Map
--------------------

ZLint maintains [a map of
top-level-domains](https://github.com/zmap/zlint/blob/master/util/gtld_map.go)
and their validity periods that is referenced by linters. As ICANN adds and
removes TLDs this map need to be updated. To do so, ensure the
`zlint-gtld-update` command is installed and in your `$PATH` and run `go
generate`:

	go get github.com/zmap/zlint/cmd/zlint-gtld-update
	go generate github.com/zmap/zlint/...
