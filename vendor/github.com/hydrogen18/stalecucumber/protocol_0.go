/**
Opcode: INT
Push an integer or bool.

      The argument is a newline-terminated decimal literal string.

      The intent may have been that this always fit in a short Python int,
      but INT can be generated in pickles written on a 64-bit box that
      require a Python long on a 32-bit box.  The difference between this
      and LONG then is that INT skips a trailing 'L', and produces a short
      int whenever possible.

      Another difference is due to that, when bool was introduced as a
      distinct type in 2.3, builtin names True and False were also added to
      2.2.2, mapping to ints 1 and 0.  For compatibility in both directions,
      True gets pickled as INT + "I01\n", and False as INT + "I00\n".
      Leading zeroes are never produced for a genuine integer.  The 2.3
      (and later) unpicklers special-case these and return bool instead;
      earlier unpicklers ignore the leading "0" and return the int.

      BUILD opcode to apply  __setstate__ to that argument.

      callable has been registered with the copy_reg module's

/**
Opcode: INST
Build a class instance.

      This is the protocol 0 version of protocol 1's OBJ opcode.
      INST is followed by two newline-terminated strings, giving a
      module and class name, just as for the GLOBAL opcode (and see
      GLOBAL for more details about that).  self.find_class(module, name)
      is used to get a class object.

      In addition, all the objects on the stack following the topmost
      markobject are gathered into a tuple and popped (along with the
      topmost markobject), just as for the TUPLE opcode.

      Now it gets complicated.  If all of these are true:

        + The argtuple is empty (markobject was at the top of the stack
          at the start).

        + It's an old-style class object (the type of the class object is
          ClassType).

        + The class object does not have a __getinitargs__ attribute.

      then we want to create an old-style class instance without invoking
      its __init__() method (pickle has waffled on this over the years; not
      calling __init__() is current wisdom).  In this case, an instance of
      an old-style dummy class is created, and then we try to rebind its
      __class__ attribute to the desired class object.  If this succeeds,
      the new instance object is pushed on the stack, and we're done.  In
      restricted execution mode it can fail (assignment to __class__ is
      disallowed), and I'm not really sure what happens then -- it looks
      like the code ends up calling the class object's __init__ anyway,
      via falling into the next case.

      Else (the argtuple is not empty, it's not an old-style class object,
      or the class object does have a __getinitargs__ attribute), the code
      first insists that the class object have a __safe_for_unpickling__
      attribute.  Unlike as for the __safe_for_unpickling__ check in REDUCE,
      it doesn't matter whether this attribute has a true or false value, it
      only matters whether it exists (XXX this is a bug; cPickle
      requires the attribute to be true).  If __safe_for_unpickling__
      doesn't exist, UnpicklingError is raised.

      Else (the class object does have a __safe_for_unpickling__ attr),
      the class object obtained from INST's arguments is applied to the
      argtuple obtained from the stack, and the resulting instance object
      is pushed on the stack.

      NOTE:  checks for __safe_for_unpickling__ went away in Python 2.3.
