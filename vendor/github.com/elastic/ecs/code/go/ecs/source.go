	// For example, the registered domain for "foo.google.com" is "google.com".
	// This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public

	// Translated ip of source based NAT sessions (e.g. internal client to
	// internet)
	// Typically connections traversing load balancers, firewalls, or routers.
