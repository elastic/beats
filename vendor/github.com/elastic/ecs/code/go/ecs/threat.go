// Fields to classify events and alerts according to a threat taxonomy such as
// the Mitre ATT&CK framework.
// These fields are for users to classify alerts from all of their sources
// (e.g. IDS, NGFW, etc.) within a  common taxonomy. The threat.tactic.* are
// meant to capture the high level category of the threat  (e.g. "impact"). The
// threat.technique.* fields are meant to capture which kind of approach is
// used by  this detected threat, to accomplish the goal (e.g. "endpoint denial
// of service").
