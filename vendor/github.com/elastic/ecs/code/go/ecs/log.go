// Fields which are specific to log events.
type Log struct {
	// Original log level of the log event.
	// Some examples are `warn`, `error`, `i`.
	Level string `ecs:"level"`

	// This is the original log message and contains the full log message
	// before splitting it up in multiple parts.
	// In contrast to the `message` field which can contain an extracted part
	// of the log message, this field contains the original, full log message.
	// It can have already some modifications applied like encoding or new
	// lines removed to clean up the log message.
	// This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled so it can't be
	// queried but the value can be retrieved from `_source`.
	Original string `ecs:"original"`
