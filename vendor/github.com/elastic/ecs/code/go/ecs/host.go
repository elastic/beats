// A host is defined as a general computing instance.
// ECS host.* fields should be populated with details about the host on which
// the event happened, or from which the measurement was taken. Host types
// include hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes.
type Host struct {
	// Hostname of the host.
	// It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host
	// machine.
	Hostname string `ecs:"hostname"`

	// Name of the host.
	// It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully
	// qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender
	// decides which value to use.
	Name string `ecs:"name"`

	// Unique host id.
	// As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your
	// environment.
	// Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.
	ID string `ecs:"id"`

	// Host ip address.
	IP string `ecs:"ip"`

	// Host mac address.
	MAC string `ecs:"mac"`

	// Type of host.
	// For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If
	// vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information
	// meaningful in your environment.
	Type string `ecs:"type"`

	// Operating system architecture.
	Architecture string `ecs:"architecture"`
