// This field set is meant to facilitate pivoting around a piece of data.
// Some pieces of information can be seen in many places in an ECS event. To
// facilitate searching for them, store an array of all seen values to their
// corresponding field in `related.`.
// A concrete example is IP addresses, which can be under host, observer,
// source, destination, client, server, and network.forwarded_ip. If you append
// all IPs to `related.ip`, you can then search for a given IP trivially, no
// matter where it appeared, by querying `related.ip:a.b.c.d`.
type Related struct {
	// All of the IPs seen on your event.
	IP string `ecs:"ip"`
