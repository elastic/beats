// An observer is defined as a special network, security, or application device
// used to detect, observe, or create network, security, or application-related
// events and metrics.
// This could be a custom hardware appliance or a server that has been
// configured to run special network, security, or application software.
// Examples include firewalls, web proxies, intrusion detection/prevention
// systems, network monitoring sensors, web application firewalls, data loss
// prevention systems, and APM servers. The observer.* fields shall be
// populated with details of the system, if any, that detects, observes and/or
// creates a network, security, or application event or metric. Message queues
// and ETL components used in processing events or metrics are not considered
// observers in ECS.
