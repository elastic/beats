// A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for events
// regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.
// For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends
// the SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the
// initiator or requestor in the network transaction. Some systems use the term
// "originator" to refer the client in TCP connections. The client fields
// describe details about the system acting as the client in the network event.
// Client fields are usually populated in conjunction with server fields.
// Client fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.
// Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange,
// which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your
// context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and
// destination are filled appropriately.

	// Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will

	// one it is.
