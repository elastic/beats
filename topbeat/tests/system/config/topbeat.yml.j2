################### Topbeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Input ############################################
input:
  # In seconds, defines how often to read server statistics
  period: {{ period | default(1) }}

  # Regular expression to match the processes that are monitored
  # By default, all the processes are monitored
  procs: [
    {%- for proc_pattern in proc_patterns|default([".*"]) -%}
        "{{ proc_pattern}}" {%- if not loop.last %}, {% endif -%}
    {%- endfor %}]

  # Statistics to collect (all enabled by default)
  stats:
    system: {{ "false" if system_stats == false else "true" }}
    process: {{ "false" if process_stats == false else "true" }}
    filesystem: {{ "false" if filesystem_stats == false else "true" }}
    cpu_per_core: {{ "false" if cpu_per_core == false else "true" }}

############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:

  ### File as output
  file:
    # Enabling file output
    enabled: true

    # Path to the directory where to save the generated files. The option is mandatory.
    path: {{ output_file_path|default(beat.working_dir + "/output") }}


    # Name of the generated files. The default is `topbeat` and it generates
    # files: `topbeat`, `topbeat.1`, `topbeat.2`, etc.
    filename: "{{ output_file_filename|default("topbeat") }}"

    # Maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, the files are
    # rotated. The default value is 10 MB.
    #rotate_every_kb: 10000

    # Maximum number of files under path. When this number of files is reached, the
    # oldest file is deleted and the rest are shifted from last to first. The default
    # is 7 files.
    #number_of_files: 7



############################# Shipper #########################################

shipper:
  # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
  # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
  # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
  #name:

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.
  #tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
  # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
  #ignore_outgoing: true


############################# Logging #########################################

#logging:
  # Send all logging output to syslog. On Windows default is false, otherwise
  # default is true.
  #to_syslog: true

  # Write all logging output to files. Beats automatically rotate files if configurable
  # limit is reached.
  #to_files: false

  # Enable debug output for selected components.
  #selectors: []

  # Set log level
  #level: error

  #files:
    # The directory where the log files will written to.
    #path: /var/log/mybeat

    # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
    #name: mybeat

    # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
    # automatically rotated
    #rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

    # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
    #keepfiles: 7
