[[topbeat-getting-started]]
== Getting Started With Topbeat

Topbeat helps you monitor the availability of your website or service by providing system-wide and per-process
statistics along with a disk usage overview.

To get started with your own Topbeat setup, install and configure these related products:

 * Elasticsearch for storage and indexing the data.
 * Kibana for the UI.
 * Logstash (optional) for inserting data into Elasticsearch.

See {libbeat}/getting-started.html[Getting Started with Beats and the Elastic Stack] for more information.

After you have installed these products, you can start <<topbeat-installation>>.


[[topbeat-installation]]
=== Step 1: Installing Topbeat

To download and install Topbeat, use the commands that work with your system
(<<deb, deb>> for Debian/Ubuntu, <<rpm, rpm>> for Redhat/Centos/Fedora, <<mac,
mac>> for OS X, and <<win, win>> for Windows).

[NOTE]
==================================================
If you use Apt or Yum, you can {libbeat}/setup-repositories.html[install Topbeat from our repositories] to update to the newest version more easily.

See our https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/topbeat[download page] for other installation options, such as 32-bit images.
==================================================

[[deb]]
*deb:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/topbeat/topbeat_{version}_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i topbeat_{version}_amd64.deb
------------------------------------------------

[[rpm]]
*rpm:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/topbeat/topbeat-{version}-x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -vi topbeat-{version}-x86_64.rpm
------------------------------------------------

[[mac]]
*mac:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/topbeat/topbeat-{version}-darwin.tgz
tar xzvf topbeat-{version}-darwin.tgz
------------------------------------------------

[[win]]
*win:*

. Download the Topbeat Windows zip file from the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/topbeat[downloads page].

. Extract the contents of the zip file into `C:\Program Files`.

. Rename the `topbeat-<version>-windows` directory to `Topbeat`.

. Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon and select *Run As Administrator*). If you are running Windows XP, you may need to download and install PowerShell.

. Run the following commands to install Topbeat as a Windows service:
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > cd 'C:\Program Files\Topbeat'
PS C:\Program Files\Topbeat> .\install-service-topbeat.ps1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If script execution is disabled on your system, you need to set the execution policy for the current session to allow the script to run. For example: `PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File .\install-service-topbeat.ps1`.

Before starting Topbeat, you should look at the configuration options in the configuration file,
for example `C:\Program Files\Topbeat\topbeat.yml`. For more information about these options, see <<topbeat-configuration-options>>.

[[topbeat-configuration]]
=== Step 2: Configuring Topbeat

To configure Topbeat, you edit the configuration file. For rpm and deb, you'll
find the configuration file at `/etc/topbeat/topbeat.yml`. For mac and win, look in
the archive that you just extracted.

Here is a sample of the `topbeat.yml` file. Topbeat uses predefined
default values for most configuration options.

[source, shell]
-------------------------------------
topbeat:
  period: 10
  procs: [".*"]
-------------------------------------

To configure Topbeat:

. Set the following options to specify how often Topbeat reads statistics and specify which processes it monitors:
+
* The `period` option defines how often to read system-wide and per-process statistics from your servers. The interval is in seconds.
By default, it's set to 10 seconds.

* The `procs` option defines a list of regular expressions to match all the processes that need to be monitored. By default, all the running processes are monitored.
+
If you are not interested in collecting per-process statistics, you can use:
+
[source, shell]
-------------------------------------
topbeat:
  stats:
    process: false
-------------------------------------

. If you are sending output to Elasticsearch, set the IP address and port where Topbeat can find the Elasticsearch installation:
+
[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# Multiple outputs may be used.
output:
  ### Elasticsearch as output
  elasticsearch:
    # Array of hosts to connect to.
     hosts: ["192.168.1.42:9200"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
If you are sending output to Logstash, see <<config-topbeat-logstash>> instead.

[[topbeat-template]]
=== Step 3: Loading the Index Template in Elasticsearch

:allplatforms:
include::../../libbeat/docs/shared-template-load.asciidoc[]

=== Step 4: Starting Topbeat

Run Topbeat by issuing the following command:

*deb:*

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/topbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------
*rpm:*

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/topbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*mac:*

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ./topbeat -e -c topbeat.yml -d "publish"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*win:*

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS C:\Program Files\Topbeat> Start-Service topbeat
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By default the log files are stored in `C:\ProgramData\topbeat\Logs`.

NOTE: On Windows, statistics about system load and swap usage are currently
not captured.

==== Testing the Topbeat Installation

To verify that your server's statistics are present in Elasticsearch, issue
the following command:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/topbeat-*/_search?pretty'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that you replace `localhost:9200` with the address of your Elasticsearch
instance.

On Windows, if you don't have cURL installed, simply point your browser to the URL.

=== Step 5: Loading Sample Kibana Dashboards

To make it easier for you to start monitoring your servers in Kibana,
we have created a sample Topbeat dashboard. This dashboard is provided as
an example. We recommend that you
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html[customize] it
to meet your needs.

For more information about loading and viewing the Beats dashboards, see
{libbeat}/visualizing-data.html[Visualizing Your Data in Kibana].

==== Example of a System-Wide Overview

You can configure the `Dashboard` page to show the statistics for all servers or for a
subset. For example, you might have a dashboard page that shows:

* CPU usage and memory consumption for the top 10 CPU-consuming processes
running on different servers
* Free and used disk space for all servers
* CPU usage per process
* Memory consumption per process

image:./images/topbeat-dashboard-example.png[Topbeat Dashboard page in Kibana]

==== Example of a Per Server Overview

To display the statistics coming from a single server, you can use a search query like *beat.name: precise32*:

You can learn more about Kibana in the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html[Kibana User Guide].
