[[monitor-icmp-options]]
=== ICMP options

Also see <<monitor-options>>.

The options described here configure {beatname_uc} to use ICMP (v4 and v6) Echo
Requests to check the configured hosts. Please note that on most platforms you
must execute Heartbeat with elevated permissions to perform ICMP pings.

On Linux, regular users may perform pings if the right file capabilities are set. Run
`sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip /path/to/heartbeat` to  grant {beatname_uc} ping capabilities on Linux.
Alternatively, one may grant ping permissions to the user {beatname_uc} runs as. To grant ping permissions
in this way, run `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range='myuserid myuserid'`.

Other platforms may require {beatname_uc} to run as root or administrator to execute pings.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
- type: icmp
  id: ping-myhost
  name: My Host Ping
  hosts: ["myhost"]
  schedule: '*/5 * * * * * *'
