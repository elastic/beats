== Browser options

*{heartbeat} browser checks are in beta and will not be made generally available.*

If you want to set up browser checks, we highly recommend using Synthetics via {observability-guide}/synthetics-get-started-project.html[Projects] or the {observability-guide}/synthetics-get-started-ui.html[Synthetics app in {kib}] to create and manage browser monitors.

If you need to refer to how beta {heartbeat} browser checks were set up previously, refer to the {beats-ref-root}/heartbeat/8.7/monitor-browser-options.html[Browser options documentation for 8.7].
