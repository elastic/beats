[[monitor-browser-options]]
=== Browser options

TIP: Want to get started with synthetic monitoring?
See the {observability-guide}/synthetics-quickstart.html[quick start guide].

The options described here configure {beatname_uc} to run the synthetic
monitoring test suites via Synthetic Agent on the Chromium browser.
Additional shared options are defined in <<monitor-options>>.
Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
- type: browser
  id: synthetic-inline-suites
  name: Elastic website
  schedule: '@every 1m'
  source:
    inline:
      script: |-
        step("load homepage", async () => {
          await page.goto('https://www.elastic.co');
        });
        step("hover over products menu", async () => {
          await page.hover('css=[data-nav-item=products]');
        });

[[monitor-browser-source]]
==== `source`

Contains information on how to run the synthetic test suites.

[float]
[[monitor-source-inline]]
===== `inline`

Runs the Synthetic test scripts that are defined inline in the configuration.
See {observability-guide}/synthetics-create-test.html[Synthetics syntax] for
more information.

This is the most convenient way to get Synthetic tests up and running, however, it becomes
harder to maintain and share code as the number of test files increases.
The recommended way to run Synthetic suites is to create an https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-init[NPM project] and
start writing individual tests for all the user journeys and save them as JavaScript or
TypeScript files. Once the project is created, the tests can be invoked either by
<<monitor-source-zipurl,Zip Url>> or <<monitor-source-local,Local directory>> method.

NOTE: {beatname_uc} will use the latest compatible version(^1.0.0) of the
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elastic/synthetics[Synthetics NPM library] to run
the inline journeys.

[[monitor-source-zipurl]]
===== `Zip URL`

Remote zip endpoint configuration allows users to specify the location
of a synthetics test project ZIP file.

Under `zip_url`, specify these options:

*`url`*:: Location of the synthetics project repository.
*`folder`*:: Relative directory path where the synthetic journey files are
located in the repository.
*`username`*:: The username for authenticating with the zip endpoint. This setting is optional.
*`password`*:: The password for authenticating with the zip endpoint. This setting is optional.

If `username` and `password` are provided, they will be sent as HTTP Basic Authentication
headers to the remote zip endpoint.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- type: browser
  id: todos-suites
  name: Todos Journeys
  schedule: '@every 1m'
  source:
    zip_url:
      url: "https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"
      folder: "examples/todos"
      username: ""
      password: ""
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[float]
[[monitor-source-local]]
===== `Local directory`

Local directory where the synthetic test files are located.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- type: browser
  id: local-journeys
  name: Local journeys
  schedule: '@every 1m'
  source:
    local:
      path: "/path/to/synthetics/journeys"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
