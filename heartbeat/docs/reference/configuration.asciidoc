== Configuration Options (Reference)

Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've completed the
<<heartbeat-configuration,configuration steps>> in the Getting Started.

The Heartbeat configuration file, +heartbeat.yml+, uses http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax. See the
{libbeat}/config-file-format.html[Config File Format] section of the
_Beats Platform Reference_ for more about the structure of the config file.

The configuration options are described in the following sections. After changing
configuration settings, you need to restart Heartbeat to pick up the changes.

* <<configuration-heartbeat-options>>
* <<configuration-general>>
* <<elasticsearch-output>>
* <<logstash-output>>
* <<kafka-output>>
* <<redis-output>>
* <<file-output>>
* <<console-output>>
* <<configuration-output-ssl>>
* <<configuration-output-codec>>
* <<configuration-path>>
* <<configuration-dashboards>>
* <<configuration-logging>>
