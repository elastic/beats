== Configuration Options (Reference)

Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've completed the
<<heartbeat-configuration,configuration steps>> in the Getting Started.

The Heartbeat configuration file, +heartbeat.yml+, uses http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax.
The configuration options are described in the following sections. After changing
configuration settings, you need to restart Heartbeat to pick up the changes.

* <<configuration-heartbeat-options>>
* <<configuration-general>>
* <<elasticsearch-output>>
