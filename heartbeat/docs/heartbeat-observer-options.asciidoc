== Add observer and geo metadata

Use the `heartbeat.run_from` option to set the geographic location fields relevant to a given heartbeat instance.

Determines which geographic location to label this monitor as running from. Note, this
can also be handled by setting the `run_from` option on an individual monitor to apply
a unique setting to just that monitor.

Takes two top-level fields: `id` and `geo`, where `id` is a string used to uniquely identify
the geographic location, and indexed as the `observer.name` field, and `geo` which is a map
conforming to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-geo.html[ECS geo fields] 
and is indexed under `observer.geo`.

Example:

```yaml
heartbeat.run_from:
  id: my-custom-geo
  geo:
	name: nyc-dc1-rack2
	location: 40.7128, -74.0060
	continent_name: North America
	country_iso_code: US
	region_name: New York
	region_iso_code: NY
	city_name: New York
```
