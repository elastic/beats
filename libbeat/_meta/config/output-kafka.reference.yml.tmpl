  # The Kafka topic used for produced events. The setting can be a format string
  # using any event field. To set the topic from document type use `%{[type]}`.

  # The Kafka event key setting. Use format string to create a unique event key.
  # By default no event key will be generated.

  # The Kafka event partitioning strategy. Default hashing strategy is `hash`
  # using the `output.kafka.key` setting or randomly distributes events if

    # If enabled, events will only be published to partitions with reachable

  # Metadata update configuration. Metadata contains leader information

  # The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.

  # The number of seconds to wait before trying to republish to Kafka
  # after a network error. After waiting backoff.init seconds, the Beat

  # Duration to wait before sending bulk Kafka request. 0 is no delay. The default
  # is 0.

  # The number of seconds to wait for responses from the Kafka brokers before
  # timing out. The default is 30s.

  #keep_alive: 0

  # Sets the output compression codec. Must be one of none, snappy and gzip. The
  # default is gzip.
  #compression: gzip

  # Set the compression level. Currently only gzip provides a compression level
  # between 0 and 9. The default value is chosen by the compression algorithm.
  #compression_level: 4

  # The maximum permitted size of JSON-encoded messages. Bigger messages will be
  # dropped. The default value is 1000000 (bytes). This value should be equal to
  # or less than the broker's message.max.bytes.
  #max_message_bytes: 1000000

  # The ACK reliability level required from broker. 0=no response, 1=wait for
  # local commit, -1=wait for all replicas to commit. The default is 1.  Note:
  # If set to 0, no ACKs are returned by Kafka. Messages might be lost silently
  # on error.
