# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group

# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
# combination of these.
#fields:
#  env: staging

# If this option is set to true, the custom fields are stored as top-level
# fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields
# sub-dictionary. Default is false.

# Configure the precision of all timestamps in {{ .BeatName | title }}.

# Internal queue configuration for buffering events to be published.
#queue:
  # Queue type by name (default 'mem')
  # The memory queue will present all available events (up to the outputs
  # bulk_max_size) to the output, the moment the output is ready to server
  # another batch of events.
  #mem:
    # Max number of events the queue can buffer.
    #events: 4096

    # Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,
    # before providing a batch of events to the outputs.
    # The default value is set to 2048.
    # A value of 0 ensures events are immediately available
    # to be sent to the outputs.
    #flush.min_events: 2048

    # Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
    # if the number of events stored in the queue is < `flush.min_events`.
    #flush.timeout: 1s

  # The disk queue stores incoming events on disk until the output is
  # ready for them. This allows a higher event limit than the memory-only
  # queue and lets pending events persist through a restart.
  #disk:
    # The directory path to store the queue's data.
    #path: "${path.data}/diskqueue"

    # The maximum space the queue should occupy on disk. Depending on
    # input settings, events that exceed this limit are delayed or discarded.
    #max_size: 10GB

    # The maximum size of a single queue data file. Data in the queue is
    # stored in smaller segments that are deleted after all their events
    # have been processed.
    #segment_size: 1GB

    # The number of events to read from disk to memory while waiting for
    # the output to request them.
    #read_ahead: 512

    # The number of events to accept from inputs while waiting for them
    # to be written to disk. If event data arrives faster than it
    # can be written to disk, this setting prevents it from overflowing
    # main memory.
    #write_ahead: 2048

    # The duration to wait before retrying when the queue encounters a disk
    # write error.
    #retry_interval: 1s

    # The maximum length of time to wait before retrying on a disk write
    # error. If the queue encounters repeated errors, it will double the
    # length of its retry interval each time, up to this maximum.
    #max_retry_interval: 30s

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. The
