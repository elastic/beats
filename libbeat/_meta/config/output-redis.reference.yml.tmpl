  # The list of Redis servers to connect to. If load-balancing is enabled, the
  # events are distributed to the servers in the list. If one server becomes
  # unreachable, the events are distributed to the reachable servers only.
  # The hosts setting supports redis and rediss urls with custom password like
  # redis://:password@localhost:6379.
  #hosts: ["localhost:6379"]

  # The name of the Redis list or channel the events are published to. The
  # default is {{.BeatName}}.
  #key: {{.BeatName}}

  # The password to authenticate to Redis with. The default is no authentication.
  #password:

  # The Redis database number where the events are published. The default is 0.
  #db: 0

  # The Redis data type to use for publishing events. If the data type is list,
  # the Redis RPUSH command is used. If the data type is channel, the Redis
  # PUBLISH command is used. The default value is list.
  #datatype: list

  # The number of workers to use for each host configured to publish events to
  # Redis. Use this setting along with the loadbalance option. For example, if
  # you have 2 hosts and 3 workers, in total 6 workers are started (3 for each
  # host).
  #worker: 1

  # If set to true and multiple hosts or workers are configured, the output
  # plugin load balances published events onto all Redis hosts. If set to false,
  # the output plugin sends all events to only one host (determined at random)
  # and will switch to another host if the currently selected one becomes
  # unreachable. The default value is true.
  #loadbalance: true

  # The Redis connection timeout in seconds. The default is 5 seconds.
  #timeout: 5s

  # The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
  # After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
  # Some Beats, such as Filebeat, ignore the max_retries setting and retry until
  # all events are published. Set max_retries to a value less than 0 to retry
  # until all events are published. The default is 3.
  #max_retries: 3

  # The number of seconds to wait before trying to reconnect to Redis
  # after a network error. After waiting backoff.init seconds, the Beat
  # tries to reconnect. If the attempt fails, the backoff timer is increased
  # exponentially up to backoff.max. After a successful connection, the backoff
  # timer is reset. The default is 1s.
  #backoff.init: 1s

  # The maximum number of seconds to wait before attempting to connect to
  # Redis after a network error. The default is 60s.
  #backoff.max: 60s

  # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Redis request or pipeline.
  # The default is 2048.
  #bulk_max_size: 2048

  # The URL of the SOCKS5 proxy to use when connecting to the Redis servers. The
  # value must be a URL with a scheme of socks5://.
  #proxy_url:

  # This option determines whether Redis hostnames are resolved locally when
  # using a proxy. The default value is false, which means that name resolution
  # occurs on the proxy server.

  # Configure SSL verification mode. If `none` is configured, all server hosts
