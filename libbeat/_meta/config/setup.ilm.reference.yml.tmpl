{{header "Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)"}}

# Configure index lifecycle management (ILM). These settings create a write
# alias and add additional settings to the index template. When ILM is enabled,
# output.elasticsearch.index is ignored, and the write alias is used to set the
# index name.

# Enable ILM support. Valid values are true, false, and auto. When set to auto
# (the default), the Beat uses index lifecycle management when it connects to a
# cluster that supports ILM; otherwise, it creates daily indices.
#setup.ilm.enabled: auto

# Set the prefix used in the index lifecycle write alias name. The default alias
# name is '{{.BeatName}}-%{[agent.version]}'.
#setup.ilm.rollover_alias: '{{.BeatIndexPrefix}}'

# Set the rollover index pattern. The default is "%{now/d}-000001".
#setup.ilm.pattern: "{now/d}-000001"

# Set the lifecycle policy name. The default policy name is
# 'beatname'.
#setup.ilm.policy_name: "mypolicy"

# The path to a JSON file that contains a lifecycle policy configuration. Used
# to load your own lifecycle policy.
#setup.ilm.policy_file:

# Disable the check for an existing lifecycle policy. The default is true. If
# you disable this check, set setup.ilm.overwrite: true so the lifecycle policy
# can be installed.
#setup.ilm.check_exists: true

# Overwrite the lifecycle policy at startup. The default is false.
#setup.ilm.overwrite: false
