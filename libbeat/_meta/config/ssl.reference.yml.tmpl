# Controls the verification of certificates. Valid values are:
# * full, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
# authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP address)
# matches the names identified within the certificate.
# * strict, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
# authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP address)
# matches the names identified within the certificate. If the Subject Alternative
# Name is empty, it returns an error.
# * certificate, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a
# trusted authority (CA), but does not perform any hostname verification.
#  * none, which performs no verification of the server's certificate. This
# mode disables many of the security benefits of SSL/TLS and should only be used
# after very careful consideration. It is primarily intended as a temporary
# diagnostic mechanism when attempting to resolve TLS errors; its use in
