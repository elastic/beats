    - name: agent
      title: Agent
      group: 2
      description: >
        The agent fields contain the data about the agent/client/shipper that
        created the event.
      footnote: >
        Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat. For APM, it is the
        agent running in the app/service. The agent information does not change if
        data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing systems
        such as Logstash or APM Server.

          type: keyword

          description: >
            Name of the agent.

            This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if
            for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host
            but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance
            data is coming from.

            If no name is given, the name is often left empty.
          example: foo

          level: core
          type: keyword
          description: >
            Type of the agent.

            The agent type stays always the same and should be given by the agent used.
            In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two
            Filebeat instances are run on the same machine.
          example: filebeat

            For log events the message field contains the log message.

            In other use cases the message field can be used to concatenate
            different values which are then freely searchable. If multiple

            This id should uniquely identify this service. This makes it possible

            Example: If you are experiencing issues with one redis instance, you
            can filter on that id to see metrics and logs for that single instance.

            Name of the service data is collected from.

            The name of the service is normally user given. This allows if two
            instances of the same service are running on the same machine
            they can be differentiated by the `service.name`.

            Also it allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to
            correlate the related instances based on the name.

            In the case of Elasticsearch the service.name could contain the cluster
            name. For Beats the service.name is by default a copy of the `service.type`
            field if no name is specified.
