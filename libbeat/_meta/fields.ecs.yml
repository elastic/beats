      by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

      events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

      For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends
      the SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator
      or requestor in the network transaction. Some systems use the term "originator"
      to refer the client in TCP connections. The client fields describe details about
      the system acting as the client in the network event. Client fields are usually
      populated in conjunction with server fields. Client fields are generally not
      populated for packet-level events.

      Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which
      is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls
      in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled

      An Elasticsearch data stream consists of one or more backing indices, and a
      data stream name forms part of the backing indices names. Due to this convention,
      data streams must also follow index naming restrictions. For example, data stream
      names cannot include `\`, `/`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, ` ` (space character),
      `,`, or `#`. Please see the Elasticsearch reference for additional https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html#indices-create-api-path-params[restrictions].'

        On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem
        object. A file always has at least one fork for the data portion, and additional
        forks may exist.

        On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default
        data stream for a file is just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used
        by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically
        of the form: `C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name`, and `some_fork_name`
        is the value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should
        populate `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`. The
        full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.'

        On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem
        object. A file always has at least one fork for the data portion, and additional
        forks may exist.

        On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default
        data stream for a file is just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used
        by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically
        of the form: `C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name`, and `some_fork_name`
        is the value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should
        populate `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`. The
        full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.'

      description: 'A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.

        On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem
        object. A file always has at least one fork for the data portion, and additional
        forks may exist.

        On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default
        data stream for a file is just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used
        by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically
        of the form: `C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name`, and `some_fork_name`
        is the value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should
        populate `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`. The
        full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.'
