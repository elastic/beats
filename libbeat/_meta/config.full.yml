# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
# combination of these.
#fields:
#  env: staging

# If this option is set to true, the custom fields are stored as top-level
# fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. The
# default is the number of logical CPUs available in the system.
#max_procs:

#================================ Processors =====================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external meta data. This section defines a list of processors
# that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# Supported processors: drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep
# the fields that contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that
# contain CPU ticks values:
#
#processors:
#- include_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu"]
#- drop_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#- drop_event:
#    when:
#       equals:
#           http.code: 200
