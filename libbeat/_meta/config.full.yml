# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
# combination of these.
#fields:
#  env: staging

# If this option is set to true, the custom fields are stored as top-level
# fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields
# sub-dictionary. Default is false.
#fields_under_root: false

# Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
# by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
# to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
#ignore_outgoing: true

# How often (in seconds) shippers are publishing their IPs to the topology map.
# The default is 10 seconds.
#refresh_topology_freq: 10

# Expiration time (in seconds) of the IPs published by a shipper to the topology map.
# All the IPs will be deleted afterwards. Note, that the value must be higher than
# refresh_topology_freq. This setting is used only by the Redis output. The other
# outputs don't support expiring entries.
# The default is 15 seconds.

# Internal queue size for single events in processing pipeline
#queue_size: 1000

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. The
# default is the number of logical CPUs available in the system.
#max_procs:

#================================ Processors =====================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external meta data. This section defines a list of processors
# that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# Supported processors: drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep
# the fields that contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that
# contain CPU ticks values:
#
#processors:
#- include_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu"]
#- drop_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#- drop_event:
#    when:
#       equals:
#           http.code: 200
