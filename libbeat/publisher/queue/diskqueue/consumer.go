	// There is a mild race condition here based on queue closure: events

	// We could try to detect this case here by checking the
	// consumer.queue.done channel, and return nothing if it's been closed.
	// But this gives rise to another race: maybe the queue was
	// closed _after_ we read those frames, and we _ought_ to return them
	// to the reader. The queue interface doesn't specify the proper
	// behavior in this case.
	//
	// Lacking formal requirements, we elect to be permissive: if we have
	// managed to read frames, then the queue already knows and considers them
	// "read," so we lose no consistency by returning them. If someone closes
	// the queue while we are draining the channel, nothing changes functionally
	// except that any ACKs after that point will be ignored. A well-behaved
	// Beats shutdown will always ACK / close its consumers before closing the
	// queue itself, so we expect this corner case not to arise in practice, but
	// if it does it is innocuous.
