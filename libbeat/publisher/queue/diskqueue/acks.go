// queuePosition represents the position of a data frame within the queue: the
// containing segment, and a byte index into that segment on disk.
// It also stores the 0-based index of the current frame within its segment
// file. (Note that this depends only on the segment file itself, and is
// unrelated to the frameID type used to identify frames in memory.)
// The frame index is logically redundant with the byte index, but
// calculating it requires a linear scan of the segment file, so we store
// both values so we can track frame counts without reading the whole segment.
// When referencing a data frame, a byteIndex of 0 / uninitialized is
// understood to mean the first frame on disk (the header offset is
// added during handling); thus, `queuePosition{segmentID: 5}` always points
// to the first frame of segment 5, even though the logical position on
// disk depends on the header size, which can vary across schema versions.
// However, a nonzero byteIndex is always interpreted as an exact
// file position.

// diskQueueACKS stores the position of the oldest unacknowledged frame,
// synchronizing it to disk using the file handle in positionFile.
// sent to a consumer, and accepts later frames in any order, advancing
// the position as the oldest one is received. When the position changes,
// positionFile is overwritten with the new value.
//
// This is a simple way to track forward progress in the queue:
// if the application terminates before all frames have been acknowledged,
// the next session will restart at the first missing frame. This means
// some later frames may be transmitted twice in this case, but it
// guarantees that we don't drop any data.
//
// When all frames in a segment file have been acknowledged, the
// segment id is sent to diskQueueACKs.segmentACKChan (which is read
// and handled in core_loop.go) indicating that it is safe to dispose
// of that segment.
//
// diskQueueACKS detects that a segment has been completely acknowledged
// using the first frame ID of each segment as a boundary: if s is a
// queueSegment, and every frame before s.firstFrameID has been
// acknowledged, then every segment before s.id has been acknowledged.
// This means it can't detect the end of the final segment, so that case
// is handled diskQueue.handleShutdown.
