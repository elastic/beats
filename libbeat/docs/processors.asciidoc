You can define processors in your configuration to process events before they
are sent to the configured output.The libbeat library provides processors for:

* reducing the number of exported fields
* enhancing events with additional metadata
* performing additional processing and decoding

Each processor receives an event, applies a defined action to the event, and
returns the event. If you define a list of processors, they are executed in the
order they are defined in the {beatname_uc} configuration file.

[source,yaml]
-------
event -> processor 1 -> event1 -> processor 2 -> event2 ...
