== Upgrading

This section gives general recommendations for upgrading the Beats.

[[upgrading-minor-versions]]
=== Upgrading Between Minor Versions

As a general rule, upgrading between minor versions (e.g. 5.x to 5.y, where x <
y) can be done by simply installing the new release and restarting the Beat
process, because the Beats keep backwards compatibility when it comes to
configuration and exported fields. Please review the <<release-notes,release
notes>> for potential exceptions.

While we keep the backwards compatibility when it comes to the exported fields,
a new minor version can add new fields (e.g. a new Metricbeat module is added).
This can be problematic if the Elasticsearch mapping settings are not updated as
well.

Please see the <<upgrade-mapping-template>> section for possible strategies in
upgrading the Elasticsearch mapping templates.

[[upgrading-1-to-5]]
=== Upgrading from 1.x to 5.x

Before upgrading your Beats, please review the <<breaking-changes, breaking
changes>> doc.

In addition to the subsections here, please read <<upgrade-mapping-template>>.

==== Migrating Configuration Files

Beats 5.0 comes with several backwards incompatible configuration changes.
However, we provide a script that can automatically fixup the most common
settings in your configuration files.

You can find this script in the Beats download packages. For the `.tar.gz` and
`.zip` archives, look under:

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./scripts/migrate_beat_config_1_x_to_5_0.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the `.deb` and `.rpm` packages, look under the
`/usr/share/<beatname>/scripts/` folder, for example:


[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/share/packetbeat/scripts/migrate_beat_config_1_x_to_5_0.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python 2.7 or later is required for executing the migration script.

To upgrade your configuration file automatically, simply pass it as an argument
to the migration script, for example:

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> ./scripts/migrate_beat_config_1_x_to_5_0.py packetbeat.yml
Backup file created: packetbeat.yml.bak
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script will automatically create a backup file and overwrite the input file
with the upgraded version. You can also use the `--dry` option, which doesn't
modify the input file, but outputs the upgraded version to stdout instead.

==== Filebeat Registry File Location and Format

Filebeat stores the read offset in a registry file that it persists to disk.
The format of this file has changed in version 5.0, but Filebeat automatically
upgrades the format on the first run, so there's normally no action required on
upgrading.

If you have installed Filebeat from the DEB or RPM packages, the location of the
file stays the same as well (`/var/lib/filebeat/registry`). Also if you've
installed Filebeat as a service on Windows, the location stays the same
(`C:\ProgramData\filebeat\registry`).

If you are running Filebeat from the `tar.gz` archive, however, the location of
the registry file has changed. In version 1.x it was by default named
`.filebeat` in the current working directory. In version 5.0, it is
`data/registry` relative to the binary location. For upgrading in this case, we
recommend copying the `.filebeat` file to `data/registry`.

==== Upgrading Topbeat to Metricbeat

NOTE: When upgrading to Metricbeat, keep in mind that any data you've collected
with Topbeat is not compatible with the 5.0 version of the Beats dashboards
because the underlying event data structures have changed. 

With the Beats 5.0 release, Topbeat is replaced by Metricbeat, which offers more
functionality. More precisely, the Topbeat functionality is roughly equivalent
to the "system" module in Metricbeat.

While there is no automatic way to convert a Topbeat configuration file to the
equivalent of a Metricbeat configuration file, both configurations are simple
enough that migrating shouldn't take long.

For example, this is the input section of the Topbeat configuration file:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input:
  # In seconds, defines how often to read server statistics
  period: 10

  # Regular expression to match the processes that are monitored
  # By default, all the processes are monitored
  procs: [".*"]

  # Statistics to collect (all enabled by default)
  stats:
    # per system statistics, by default is true
    system: true

    # per process statistics, by default is true
    process: true

    # file system information, by default is true
    filesystem: true

    # cpu usage per core, by default is false
    cpu_per_core: false
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And here is the equivalent configuration for the system module in Metricbeat:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
metricbeat.modules:

#------------------------------- System Module -------------------------------
- module: system
  metricsets:
    # CPU stats
    - cpu

    # System Load stats
    - load

    # Per filesystem stats
    - filesystem

    # Memory stats
    - memory

    # Network stats
    - network

    # Per process stats
    - process
  enabled: true
  period: 10s
  processes: ['.*']
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The remaining configuration options (outputs, name, tags) stay the same or can
be upgraded using the migration script.

[[upgrade-mapping-template]]
=== Upgrading the Elasticsearch Mapping Template

By default, the Elasticsearch mapping template that comes with the Beats is not
re-installed if it already exists.  This means that if the new Beats version
adds new fields (e.g. a new module in Metricbeat), they won't be reflected in
the Elasticsearch mapping, which can result in visualization problems or
incorrect data.

You can set the `output.elasticsearch.template.overwrite` option to `true` to
make the Beats install the new mapping template even if a template with the same
name already exists. You can set this option in the configuration file or as a
CLI flag, for example:

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
packetbeat -e -E output.elasticsearch.template.overwrite=true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, the mapping template is applied on index creation, so it won't affect
the current index if it was already created with the old version.

You can force the start of a new index by renaming the old index before starting
the new version of the Beat. As of Elasticsearch 5.0, this can be done via the
re-index API:


[source,json]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "packetbeat-2016.09.20"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "packetbeat-2016.09.20-old"
  }
}
DELETE /packetbeat-2016.09.20
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the reindex API command can take a long time, depending on the size of
the index. It is recommended that you stop the Beat during this time, so the
order of operations should be:

1. Stop the old version of the Beat
2. Rename the index of the current day
3. Start the new version of the Beat

If downtime is not acceptable, another possible approach is to configure a
different index pattern in the new Beat version, but this will likely require
adjustments to your Kibana dashboards.
