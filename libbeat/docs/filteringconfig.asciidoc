[[configuration-filter]]
=== Filter

You can set options in the `filters` section of the {beatname_uc} config file to reduce the number of fields that are
exported by the Beat. See <<exported-fields>> for the full list of possible fields.

The filter actions that you specify are applied to each event before it's sent to the defined output. You can define
multiple filter actions. The filter actions are executed in the order that they're defined in the config file.

==== Filter Options

You can specify the following options under the `filters` section:

[[include-fields]]
===== include_fields

The `include_fields` action specifies the list of fields to export. For each field, you can specify a simple field
name, or a nested map. For example, if you specify `dns.question.name`, the Beat exports only the `name` field
because it's a simple field. If you specify `dns.question`, the Beat exports all the fields nested under
`dns.question`.

Example configuration:

[source, yaml]
-----------------------------------------------------
filters:
 - include_fields:
     fields: ["field_A", "field_B", "field_C"]
-----------------------------------------------------

If `include_fields` is not specified, all fields are exported by default.

See <<filtering-data>> for specific {beatname_uc} examples.

NOTE: If you specify an empty list for `include_fields`, only the required fields, `@timestamp` and `type`, are
exported.

[[drop-fields]]
===== drop_fields

The `drop_fields` action defines a list of fields to drop. For each field, you can specify a simple field name, or a
nested map. For example, if you specify `dns.question.name`, the Beat drops only the `name` field because it's a
simple field. If you specify `dns.question`, the Beat drops all the fields nested under `dns.question`. Some fields,
such as `@timestamp` and `type`, are mandatory and cannot be removed because they are required by the outputs.

Example configuration:

[source, yaml]
-----------------------------------------------------
filters:
 - drop_fields:
     fields: ["field_A"]
-----------------------------------------------------

See <<filtering-data>> for specific {beatname_uc} examples.
