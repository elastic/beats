== Getting started with {beats}

Each Beat is a separately installable product. Before installing Beats, you need
to install and configure the {stack}. To learn how to get up and running
quickly, see {stack-ov}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the
{stack}].

[TIP]
==============
You can skip having to install {es} and {kib} by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud. The {es} Service is available on both AWS and GCP.
