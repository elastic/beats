== Getting Started with Beats and the Elastic Stack 

Looking for an "ELK tutorial" that shows how to set up the Elastic stack for Beats? You've
come to the right place. The topics in this section describe how to install and configure
the Elastic stack for Beats.

A regular _Beats setup_ consists of:

 * Elasticsearch for storage and indexing. See <<elasticsearch-installation>>.
 * Logstash (optional) for inserting data into Elasticsearch. See <<logstash-installation,Installing Logstash>>.
 * Kibana for the UI. See <<kibana-installation>>.
 * One or more Beats. You install the Beats on your servers to capture operational data. See <<installing-beats>>.
 * Kibana dashboards for visualizing the data.
 
See the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for information 
about supported operating systems and product compatibility.

NOTE: To get started, you can install Elasticsearch and Kibana on a
single VM or even on your laptop. The only condition is that the machine must be
accessible from the servers you want to monitor. As you add more Beats and
your traffic grows, you'll want to replace the single Elasticsearch instance with
a cluster. You'll probably also want to automate the installation process.


[[elasticsearch-installation]]
=== Installing Elasticsearch

https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] is a real-time,
distributed storage, search, and analytics engine. It can be used for many
purposes, but one context where it excels is indexing streams of semi-structured
data, such as logs or decoded network packets.

The binary packages of Elasticsearch have only one dependency: Java. The minimum
supported version is Java 8. To download and install
Elasticsearch, use the commands that work with your system
(<<deb, deb>> for Debian/Ubuntu, <<rpm, rpm>> for Redhat/Centos/Fedora, <<mac,
mac>> for OS X, and <<win, win>> for Windows):

[[deb]]*deb:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Elasticsearch has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{ES-version}.deb
sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-{ES-version}.deb
sudo /etc/init.d/elasticsearch start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

[[rpm]]*rpm:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Elasticsearch has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{ES-version}.rpm
sudo rpm -i elasticsearch-{ES-version}.rpm
sudo service elasticsearch start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

[[mac]]*mac:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Elasticsearch has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
# install Java, e.g. from: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{ES-version}.zip
unzip elasticsearch-{ES-version}.zip
cd elasticsearch-{ES-version}
./bin/elasticsearch
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

[[win]]*win:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Elasticsearch has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

. If necessary, download and install the latest version of the Java from https://www.java.com[www.java.com].

. Download the Elasticsearch {ES-version} Windows zip file from the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[downloads page].

. Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory on your computer, for example, `C:\Program Files`.

. Open a command prompt as an Administrator and navigate to the directory that contains the extracted files, for example:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-{ES-version}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

. Run the following command to start Elasticsearch:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
bin\elasticsearch.bat
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

You can learn more about installing, configuring, and running Elasticsearch in the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html[Elasticsearch Reference].

==== Making Sure Elasticsearch is Up and Running


To test that the Elasticsearch daemon is up and running, try sending an HTTP GET
request on port 9200.

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl http://127.0.0.1:9200
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On Windows, if you don't have cURL installed, simply point your browser to the URL.

You should see a response similar to this:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
{
  "name" : "ofgAtrJ",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "3h9xSrVlRJmDHgQ8FLnByA",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "{ES-version}",
    "build_hash" : "db0d481",
    "build_date" : "2017-02-09T22:05:32.386Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "6.4.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[[logstash-installation]]
=== Installing Logstash (Optional)

The simplest architecture for the Beats platform setup consists of one or more Beats,
Elasticsearch, and Kibana. This architecture is easy to get started
with and sufficient for networks with low traffic. It also uses the minimum amount of
servers: a single machine running Elasticsearch and Kibana. The Beats
insert the transactions directly into the Elasticsearch instance. 

If you want to perform additional processing or buffering on the data, however,
you'll want to install Logstash. 

An important advantage to this approach is that you can
use Logstash to modify the data captured by Beats in any way you like. You can also
use Logstash's many output plugins to integrate with other systems.

To download and install Logstash, use the commands that work
with your system:

*deb:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Logstash has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/logstash/logstash-{LS-version}.deb
sudo dpkg -i logstash-{LS-version}.deb
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

*rpm:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Logstash has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/logstash/logstash-{LS-version}.rpm
sudo rpm -i logstash-{LS-version}.rpm
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

*mac:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Logstash has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
# install Java, e.g. from: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/logstash/logstash-{LS-version}.zip
unzip logstash-{LS-version}.zip
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

*win:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Logstash has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

. If necessary, download and install the latest version of the Java from https://www.java.com[www.java.com].

. Download the Logstash {LS-version} Windows zip file from the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash[downloads page].

. Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory on your computer, for example, `C:\Program Files`.

Don't start Logstash yet. You need to set a couple of configuration options first.

endif::[]

[[logstash-setup]]
==== Setting Up Logstash

In this setup, the Beat sends events to Logstash. Logstash receives
these events by using the {logstashdoc}/plugins-inputs-beats.html[Beats input plugin for Logstash] and then sends the transaction to Elasticsearch by using the
{logstashdoc}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html[Elasticsearch
output plugin for Logstash]. The Elasticsearch output plugin uses the bulk API, making
indexing very efficient.

To set up Logstash:

. Make sure you have the latest compatible version of the Beats input plugin for
Logstash installed.
+
The Beats input plugin requires Logstash 1.5.4 or later. If you are using
Logstash 1.5.4, you must install the Beats input plugin before applying this
configuration because the plugin is not shipped with 1.5.4. 
+
To install
the required plugin, run the following command inside the logstash directory
(for deb and rpm installs, the directory is `/opt/logstash`).
+
*deb, rpm, and mac:*
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-input-beats
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
*win:*
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
bin\logstash-plugin install logstash-input-beats
----------------------------------------------------------------------

. Configure Logstash to listen on port 5044 for incoming Beats connections
and to index into Elasticsearch. You configure Logstash by creating a
configuration file. For example, you can save the following example configuration
to a file called `logstash.conf`:
+
--
[source,ruby]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => "localhost:9200"
    manage_template => false
    index => "%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}" <1>
    document_type => "%{[@metadata][type]}" <2>
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> `%{[@metadata][beat]}` sets the first part of the index name to the value
of the `beat` metadata field, and `%{+YYYY.MM.dd}` sets the second part of the
name to a date based on the Logstash `@timestamp` field. For example:
+{beatname_lc}-2017.03.29+.
<2> `%{[@metadata][type]}` sets the document type based on the value of the `type`
metadata field.

Logstash uses this configuration to index events in Elasticsearch in the same
way that the Beat would, but you get additional buffering and other capabilities
provided by Logstash.
--

To use this setup, you'll also need to configure your Beat to use Logstash. For more information, see the documentation for the Beat.

[[logstash-input-update]]
==== Updating the Beats Input Plugin for Logstash

Plugins have their own release cycle and are often released independent of
Logstash’s core release cycle. To ensure that you have the latest version of
the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-beats.html[Beats input plugin for Logstash], 
run the following command from your Logstash installation:

*deb, rpm, and mac:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-input-beats
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*win:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
bin\logstash-plugin update logstash-input-beats
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind that you can update to the latest version of the plugin without
having to upgrade to a newer version of Logstash. More details about working
with input plugins in Logstash are available
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/working-with-plugins.html[here].


==== Starting Logstash

Now you can start Logstash. Use the command that works with your system. If you
installed Logstash as a deb or rpm package, make sure the config file is in the
expected directory.

*deb:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/logstash start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*rpm:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo service logstash start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*mac:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./bin/logstash -f logstash.conf
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*win:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
bin\logstash.bat -f logstash.conf
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The default configuration for Beats and Logstash uses plain TCP. For
encryption you must explicitly enable SSL when you configure Beats and Logstash.

You can learn more about installing, configuring, and running Logstash
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/getting-started-with-logstash.html[here].

[[kibana-installation]]
=== Installing Kibana

https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[Kibana] is a visualization application
that gets its data from Elasticsearch. It provides a customizable and
user-friendly UI in which you can combine various widget types to create your
own dashboards. The dashboards can be easily saved, shared, and linked.

For getting started, we recommend installing Kibana on the same server as
Elasticsearch, but it is not required. If you install the products on different servers,
you'll need to change the URL (IP:PORT) of the Elasticsearch server in the
Kibana configuration file, `config/kibana.yml`, before starting Kibana.

Use the following commands to download and run Kibana.

*deb or rpm:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Kibana has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-{Kibana-version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzvf kibana-{Kibana-version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd kibana-{Kibana-version}-linux-x86_64/
./bin/kibana
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

*mac:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Kibana has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-{Kibana-version}-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzvf kibana-{Kibana-version}-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
cd kibana-{Kibana-version}-darwin-x86_64/
./bin/kibana
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

*win:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {stack-version} of Kibana has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

. Download the Kibana {Kibana-version} Windows zip file from the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana[downloads page].

. Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory on your computer, for example, `C:\Program Files`.

. Open a command prompt as an Administrator and navigate to the directory that
contains the extracted files, for example:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd C:\Program Files\kibana-{Kibana-version}-windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------

. Run the following command to start Kibana:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
bin\kibana.bat
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

You can find Kibana binaries for other operating systems on the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana[Kibana downloads page].

==== Launching the Kibana Web Interface

To launch the Kibana web interface, point your browser to port 5601. For example,
http://127.0.0.1:5601[http://127.0.0.1:5601].

You can learn more about Kibana in the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html[Kibana User Guide].
