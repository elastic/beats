[[elasticsearch-output]]
=== Elasticsearch Output Configuration

When you specify Elasticsearch for the output, the Beat sends the transactions directly to Elasticsearch by using the Elasticsearch HTTP API.

Example configuration:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  template.enabled: true
  template.path: "{beatname_lc}.template.json"
  template.overwrite: false
  index: "{beatname_lc}"
  ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]
  ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
  ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable SSL, just add `https` to all URLs defined under __hosts__.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://localhost:9200"]
  username: "admin"
  password: "s3cr3t"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Elasticsearch nodes are defined by `IP:PORT`, then add `protocol: https` to the yaml file.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost"]
  protocol: "https"
  username: "admin"
  password: "s3cr3t"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Compatibility

This output works with all compatible versions of Elasticsearch. See "Supported Beats Versions" in the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#show_compatibility[Elastic Support Matrix].

==== Elasticsearch Output Options

You can specify the following options in the `elasticsearch` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== enabled

The enabled config is a boolean setting to enable or disable the output. If set
to false, the output is disabled.

The default value is true.


[[hosts-option]]
===== hosts

The list of Elasticsearch nodes to connect to. The events are distributed to
these nodes in round robin order. If one node becomes unreachable, the event is
automatically sent to another node. Each Elasticsearch node can be defined as a `URL` or `IP:PORT`.
For example: `http://192.15.3.2`, `https://es.found.io:9230` or `192.24.3.2:9300`.
If no port is specified, `9200` is used.

NOTE: When a node is defined as an `IP:PORT`, the _scheme_ and _path_ are taken from the
<<protocol-option>> and <<path-option>> config options.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["10.45.3.2:9220", "10.45.3.1:9230"]
  protocol: https
  path: /elasticsearch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous example, the Elasticsearch nodes are available at `https://10.45.3.2:9220/elasticsearch` and
`https://10.45.3.1:9230/elasticsearch`.

===== compression_level

The gzip compression level. Setting this value to 0 disables compression.
The compression level must be in the range of 1 (best speed) to 9 (best compression).

Increasing the compression level will reduce the network usage but will increase the cpu usage.

The default value is 0.

===== worker

The number of workers per configured host publishing events to Elasticsearch. This
is best used with load balancing mode enabled. Example: If you have 2 hosts and
3 workers, in total 6 workers are started (3 for each host).

===== username

The basic authentication username for connecting to Elasticsearch.

===== password

The basic authentication password for connecting to Elasticsearch.

===== parameters

Dictionary of HTTP parameters to pass within the url with index operations.

[[protocol-option]]
===== protocol

The name of the protocol Elasticsearch is reachable on. The options are:
`http` or `https`. The default is `http`. However, if you specify a URL for
<<hosts-option>>, the value of `protocol` is overridden by whatever scheme you
specify in the URL.

[[path-option]]
===== path

An HTTP path prefix that is prepended to the HTTP API calls. This is useful for
the cases where Elasticsearch listens behind an HTTP reverse proxy that exports
the API under a custom prefix.

===== headers

Custom HTTP headers to add to each request created by the Elasticsearch output.
Example:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch.headers:
  X-My-Header: Header contents
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is generally possible to specify multiple header values for the same header
name by separating them with a comma.

===== proxy_url

The URL of the proxy to use when connecting to the Elasticsearch servers. The
value may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]", in which case the "http"
scheme is assumed. If a value is not specified through the configuration file
then proxy environment variables are used. See the
https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment[golang documentation]
for more information about the environment variables.

===== index

The index name to write events to. The default is "{beatname_lc}-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}" (for example, "{beatname_lc}-2015.04.26").

===== indices

Array of index selector rules supporting conditionals, format string
based field access and name mappings. The first rule matching will be used to
set the `index` for the event to be published. If `indices` is missing or no
rule matches, the `index` field will be used.

Rule settings:

*`index`*: The index format string to use. If the fields used are missing, the rule fails.

*`mapping`*: Dictionary mapping index names to new names

*`default`*: Default string value if `mapping` does not find a match.

*`when`*: Condition which must succeed in order to execute the current rule.

Examples elasticsearch output with `indices`:

["source","yaml"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  index: "logs-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
  indices:
    - index: "critical-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      when.contains:
        message: "CRITICAL"
    - index: "error-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      when.contains:
        message: "ERR"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== pipeline

A format string value that specifies the ingest node pipeline to write events to.

["source","yaml"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  pipeline: my_pipeline_id
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more information, see <<configuring-ingest-node>>.

===== pipelines

Similar to the `indices` array, this is an array of pipeline selector
configurations supporting conditionals, format string based field access
and name mappings. The first rule matching will be used to set the
`pipeline` for the event to be published. If `pipelines` is missing or
no rule matches, the `pipeline` field will be used.

Example elasticsearch output with `pipelines`:

["source","yaml"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.prospectors:
- paths: ["/var/log/app/normal/*.log"]
  fields:
    type: "normal"
- paths: ["/var/log/app/critical/*.log"]
  fields:
    type: "critical"

output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  index: "filebeat-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
  pipelines:
    - pipeline: critical_pipeline
      when.equals:
        type: "critical"
    - pipeline: normal_pipeline
      when.equals:
        type: "normal"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== template

The http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html[index
template] to use for setting mappings in Elasticsearch. By default, template loading is
enabled.

You can adjust the following settings to load your own template or overwrite an existing one:

*`enabled`*:: Set to false to disable template loading. If set this to false,
you must <<load-template-manually,load the template manually>>.

*`name`*:: The name of the template. The default is +{beatname_lc}+.

*`path`*:: The path to the template file. The default is +{beatname_lc}.template.json+. If a relative
path is set, it is considered relative to the config path. See the <<directory-layout>> section for
details.

*`overwrite`*:: A boolean that specifies whether to overwrite the existing template. The default
is false.

For example:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  template.name: "{beatname_lc}"
  template.path: "{beatname_lc}.template.json"
  template.overwrite: false
----------------------------------------------------------------------

===== template.versions

In the default configuration, {beatname_uc} automatically checks the
Elasticsearch version and loads the recommended template file for the particular
version. This behaviour can be controlled from the following options:

*`2x.path`*:: The path to the template file to load for
Elasticsearch versions 2.x.y. The default is +{beatname_lc}.template-es2x.json+.

*`2x.enabled`*:: If set to +false+, the +2x.path+ option is ignored and the
default template is loaded regardless of the Elasticsearch version.

For example:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  template.path: "{beatname_lc}.template.json"
  template.overwrite: false
  template.versions.2x.path: "{beatname_lc}.template-es2x.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

===== max_retries

The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
Some Beats, such as Filebeat, ignore the `max_retries` setting and retry until all
events are published.

Set `max_retries` to a value less than 0 to retry until all events are published.

The default is 3.

===== bulk_max_size

The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Elasticsearch bulk API index request. The default is 50.

If the Beat sends single events, the events are collected into batches. If the Beat publishes
a large batch of events (larger than the value specified by `bulk_max_size`), the batch is
split.

Specifying a larger batch size can improve performance by lowering the overhead of sending events.
However big batch sizes can also increase processing times, which might result in
API errors, killed connections, timed-out publishing requests, and, ultimately, lower
throughput.

Setting `bulk_max_size` to values less than or equal to 0 disables buffering in libbeat. When buffering is disabled,
Beats that publish single events (such as Packetbeat) send each event directly to
Elasticsearch. Beats that publish data in batches (such as Filebeat) send events in batches based on the
spooler size.

===== timeout

The http request timeout in seconds for the Elasticsearch request. The default is 90.

===== flush_interval

The number of seconds to wait for new events between two bulk API index requests.
If `bulk_max_size` is reached before this interval expires, additional bulk index
requests are made.

[[save_topology]]
===== save_topology

deprecated[5.0.0]

A Boolean that specifies whether the topology is kept in Elasticsearch. The default is
false.

This option is relevant for Packetbeat only.

===== ssl

Configuration options for SSL parameters like the certificate authority to use
for HTTPS-based connections. If the `tls` section is missing, the host CAs are used for HTTPS connections to
Elasticsearch.

See <<configuration-output-ssl>> for more information.


[[logstash-output]]
=== Logstash Output Configuration

The Logstash output sends the events directly to Logstash by using the lumberjack
protocol, which runs over TCP. To use this option, you must
{libbeat}/logstash-installation.html#logstash-setup[install and configure] the Beats input
plugin for Logstash. Logstash allows for additional processing and routing of
generated events.

Every event sent to Logstash contains additional metadata for indexing and filtering:

[source,json]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
    ...
    "@metadata": {
      "beat": "<beat>",
      "type": "<event type>"
    }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Logstash, you can configure the Elasticsearch output plugin to use the
metadata and event type for indexing.

The following Logstash configuration file for the versions 2.x and 5.x sets Logstash to
use the index and document type reported by Beats for indexing events into Elasticsearch.
The index used will depend on the `@timestamp` field as identified by Logstash.

[source,logstash]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    document_type => "%{[@metadata][type]}"
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Events indexed into Elasticsearch with the Logstash configuration shown here
will be similar to events directly indexed by Beats into Elasticsearch.

Here is an example of how to configure the Beat to use Logstash:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["localhost:5044"]
  index: {beatname_lc}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Compatibility

This output works with all compatible versions of Logstash. See "Supported Beats Versions" in the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#show_compatibility[Elastic Support Matrix].

==== Logstash Output Options

You can specify the following options in the `logstash` section of the
+{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== enabled

The enabled config is a boolean setting to enable or disable the output. If set
to false, the output is disabled.

The default value is true.

[[hosts]]
===== hosts

The list of known Logstash servers to connect to. If load balancing is disabled, but 
multiple hosts are configured, one host is selected randomly (there is no precedence). 
If one host becomes unreachable, another one is selected randomly.

All entries in this list can contain a port number. If no port number is given, the 
value specified for <<port>> is used as the default port number.

===== compression_level

The gzip compression level. Setting this value to 0 disables compression.
The compression level must be in the range of 1 (best speed) to 9 (best compression).

Increasing the compression level will reduce the network usage but will increase the cpu usage.

The default value is 3.

===== worker

The number of workers per configured host publishing events to Logstash. This
is best used with load balancing mode enabled. Example: If you have 2 hosts and
3 workers, in total 6 workers are started (3 for each host).

[[loadbalance]]
===== loadbalance

If set to true and multiple Logstash hosts are configured, the output plugin
load balances published events onto all Logstash hosts. If set to false,
the output plugin sends all events to only one host (determined at random) and
will switch to another host if the selected one becomes unresponsive. The default value is false.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["localhost:5044", "localhost:5045"]
  loadbalance: true
  index: {beatname_lc}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== pipelining

Configures number of batches to be send asynchronously to logstash while waiting
for ACK from logstash. Output only becomes blocking once number of `pipelining`
batches have been written. Pipelining is disabled if a values of 0 is
configured. The default value is 0.

[[port]]
===== port

deprecated[5.0.0]

The default port to use if the port number is not given in <<hosts>>. The default port number
is 10200.

===== proxy_url

The URL of the SOCKS5 proxy to use when connecting to the Logstash servers. The
value must be a URL with a scheme of `socks5://`. The protocol used to
communicate to Logstash is not based on HTTP so a web-proxy cannot be used.

If the SOCKS5 proxy server requires client authentication, then a username and
password can be embedded in the URL as shown in the example.

When using a proxy, hostnames are resolved on the proxy server instead of on the
client. You can change this behavior by setting the
<<logstash-proxy-use-local-resolver,proxy_use_local_resolver>> option.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["remote-host:5044"]
  proxy_url: socks5://user:password@socks5-proxy:2233
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[logstash-proxy-use-local-resolver]]
===== proxy_use_local_resolver

The `proxy_use_local_resolver` option determines if Logstash hostnames are
resolved locally when using a proxy. The default value is false which means
that when a proxy is used the name resolution occurs on the proxy server.

===== index

The index root name to write events to. The default is the Beat name.
For example "{beatname_lc}" generates "[{beatname_lc}-]YYYY.MM.DD" indexes (for example,
"{beatname_lc}-2015.04.26").

===== ssl

Configuration options for SSL parameters like the root CA for Logstash connections. See
<<configuration-output-ssl>> for more information. To use SSL, you must also configure the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-beats.html[Beats input plugin for Logstash] to use SSL/TLS.

===== timeout

The number of seconds to wait for responses from the Logstash server before timing out. The default is 30 (seconds).

===== max_retries

The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
Some Beats, such as Filebeat, ignore the `max_retries` setting and retry until all
events are published.

Set `max_retries` to a value less than 0 to retry until all events are published.

The default is 3.

===== bulk_max_size

The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Logstash request. The default is 2048.

If the Beat sends single events, the events are collected into batches. If the Beat publishes
a large batch of events (larger than the value specified by `bulk_max_size`), the batch is
split.

Specifying a larger batch size can improve performance by lowering the overhead of sending events.
However big batch sizes can also increase processing times, which might result in
API errors, killed connections, timed-out publishing requests, and, ultimately, lower
throughput.

Setting `bulk_max_size` to values less than or equal to 0 disables buffering in libbeat. When buffering is disabled,
Beats that publish single events (such as Packetbeat) send each event directly to
Elasticsearch. Beats that publish data in batches (such as Filebeat) send events in batches based on the
spooler size.

[[kafka-output]]
=== Kafka Output Configuration

The Kafka output sends the events to Apache Kafka.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.kafka:
  # initial brokers for reading cluster metadata
  hosts: ["kafka1:9092", "kafka2:9092", "kafka3:9092"]

  # message topic selection + partitioning
  topic: '%{[type]}'
  partition.round_robin:
    reachable_only: false

  required_acks: 1
  compression: gzip
  max_message_bytes: 1000000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Events bigger than <<kafka-max_message_bytes,`max_message_bytes`>> will be dropped. To avoid this problem, make sure {beatname_uc} does not generate events bigger than <<kafka-max_message_bytes,`max_message_bytes`>>.

==== Compatibility

This output works with Kafka 0.8, 0.9, and 0.10.

==== Kafka Output Options

You can specify the following options in the `kafka` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== enabled

The enabled config is a boolean setting to enable or disable the output. If set
to false, the output is disabled.

The default value is true.

===== hosts

The list of Kafka broker addresses from where to fetch the cluster metadata.
The cluster metadata contain the actual Kafka brokers events are published to.

===== version

Kafka version ${beatname_lc} is assumed to run against. Defaults to oldest
supported stable version (currently version 0.8.2.0).

Event timestamps will be added, if version 0.10.0.0+ is enabled.

Valid values are `0.8.2.0`, `0.8.2.1`, `0.8.2.2`, `0.8.2`, `0.8`, `0.9.0.0`,
`0.9.0.1`, `0.9.0`, `0.9`, `0.10.0.0`, `0.10.0`, and `0.10`.

===== username

The username for connecting to Kafka. If username is configured, the password
must be configured as well. Only SASL/PLAIN is supported.

===== password

The password for connecting to Kafka.

===== topic

The Kafka topic used for produced events. The setting can be a format string
using any event field. To set the topic from document type use `%{[type]}`.

===== topics

Array of topic selector rules supporting conditionals, format string
based field access and name mappings. The first rule matching will be used to
set the `topic` for the event to be published. If `topics` is missing or no
rule matches, the `topic` field will be used.

Rule settings:

*`topic`*: The topic format string to use. If the fields used are missing, the
 rule fails.

*`mapping`*: Dictionary mapping index names to new names

*`default`*: Default string value if `mapping` does not find a match.

*`when`*: Condition which must succeed in order to execute the current rule.

===== key

Optional Kafka event key. If configured, the event key must be unique and can be extracted from the event using a format string.

===== partition

Kafka output broker event partitioning strategy. Must be one of `random`,
`round_robin`, or `hash`. By default the `hash` partitioner is used.

*`random.group_events`*: Sets the number of events to be published to the same
 partition, before the partitioner selects a new partition by random. The
 default value is 1 meaning after each event a new partition is picked randomly.

*`round_robin.group_events`*: Sets the number of events to be published to the
 same partition, before the partitioner selects the next partition. The default
 value is 1 meaning after each event the next partition will be selected.

*`hash.hash`*: List of fields used to compute the partitioning hash value from.
 If no field is configured, the events `key` value will be used.

*`hash.random`*: Randomly distribute events if no hash or key value can be computed.

All partitioners will try to publish events to all partitions by default. If a
partition's leader becomes unreachable for the beat, the output might block. All
partitioners support setting `reachable_only` to overwrite this
behavior. If `reachable_only` is set to `true`, events will be published to
available partitions only.

NOTE: Publishing to a subset of available partitions potentially increases resource usage because events may become unevenly distributed.

===== client_id

The configurable ClientID used for logging, debugging, and auditing purposes. The default is "beats".

===== worker

The number of concurrent load-balanced Kafka output workers.

===== codec

Output codec configuration. If the `codec` section is missing, events will be json encoded.

See <<configuration-output-codec>> for more information.

===== metadata

Kafka metadata update settings. The metadata do contain information about
brokers, topics, partition, and active leaders to use for publishing.

*`refresh_frequency`*:: Metadata refresh interval. Defaults to 10 minutes.

*`retry.max`*:: Total number of metadata update retries when cluster is in middle of leader election. The default is 3.

*`retry.backoff`*:: Waiting time between retries during leader elections. Default is 250ms.

===== max_retries

The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
Some Beats, such as Filebeat, ignore the `max_retries` setting and retry until all
events are published.

Set `max_retries` to a value less than 0 to retry until all events are published.

The default is 3.

===== bulk_max_size

The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Kafka request. The default is 2048.

===== timeout

The number of seconds to wait for responses from the Kafka brokers before timing
out. The default is 30 (seconds).

===== broker_timeout

The maximum duration a broker will wait for number of required ACKs. The default is 10s.

===== channel_buffer_size

Per Kafka broker number of messages buffered in output pipeline. The default is 256.

===== keep_alive

The keep-alive period for an active network connection. If 0s, keep-alives are disabled. The default is 0 seconds.

===== compression

Sets the output compression codec. Must be one of `none`, `snappy` and `gzip`. The default is `gzip`.

[[kafka-max_message_bytes]]
===== max_message_bytes

The maximum permitted size of JSON-encoded messages. Bigger messages will be dropped. The default value is 1000000 (bytes). This value should be equal to or less than the broker's `message.max.bytes`.

===== required_acks

The ACK reliability level required from broker. 0=no response, 1=wait for local commit, -1=wait for all replicas to commit. The default is 1.

Note: If set to 0, no ACKs are returned by Kafka. Messages might be lost silently on error.

===== flush_interval

The number of seconds to wait for new events between two producer API calls.

===== ssl

Configuration options for SSL parameters like the root CA for Kafka connections. See
<<configuration-output-ssl>> for more information.

[[redis-output]]
=== Redis Output Configuration

The Redis output inserts the events into a Redis list or a Redis channel.
This output plugin is compatible with
the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-redis.html[Redis input plugin] for Logstash.

Example configuration:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.redis:
  hosts: ["localhost"]
  password: "my_password"
  key: "{beatname_lc}"
  db: 0
  timeout: 5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Compatibility

This output works with Redis 3.2.4.

==== Redis Output Options

You can specify the following options in the `redis` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== enabled

The enabled config is a boolean setting to enable or disable the output. If set
to false, the output is disabled.

The default value is true.

===== hosts

The list of Redis servers to connect to. If load balancing is enabled, the events are
distributed to the servers in the list. If one server becomes unreachable, the events are
distributed to the reachable servers only. You can define each Redis server by specifying
`HOST` or `HOST:PORT`. For example: `"192.15.3.2"` or `"test.redis.io:12345"`. If you
don't specify a port number, the value configured by `port` is used.

===== port

deprecated[5.0.0]

The Redis port to use if `hosts` does not contain a port number. The default is 6379.

===== index

deprecated[5.0.0,The `index` setting is renamed to `key`]

The name of the Redis list or channel the events are published to. The default is
"{beatname_lc}".

===== key

The name of the Redis list or channel the events are published to. The default is
"{beatname_lc}".

The redis key can be set dynamically using a format string accessing any
fields in the event to be published.

This configuration will use the `fields.list` field to set the redis list key. If
`fields.list` is missing, `fallback` will be used.

["source","yaml"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.redis:
  hosts: ["localhost"]
  key: "%{[fields.list]:fallback}"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== keys

Array of key selector configurations supporting conditionals, format string
based field access and name mappings. The first rule matching will be used to
set the `key` for the event to be published. If `keys` is missing or no
rule matches, the `key` field will be used.

Rule settings:

*`key`*: The key format string. If the fields used in the format string are missing, the rule fails.

*`mapping`*: Dictionary mapping key values to new names

*`default`*: Default string value if `mapping` does not find a match.

*`when`*: Condition which must succeed in order to execute the current rule.

Example `keys` settings:

["source","yaml"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.redis:
  hosts: ["localhost"]
  key: "default_list"
  keys:
    - key: "info_list"   # send to info_list if `message` field contains INFO
      when.contains:
        message: "INFO"
    - key: "debug_list"  # send to debug_list if `message` field contains DEBUG
      when.contains:
        message: "DEBUG"
    - key: "%{[type]}"
      mapping:
        "http": "frontend_list"
        "nginx": "frontend_list"
        "mysql": "backend_list"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== password

The password to authenticate with. The default is no authentication.

===== db

The Redis database number where the events are published. The default is 0.

===== datatype

The Redis data type to use for publishing events.If the data type is `list`, the
Redis RPUSH command is used and all events are added to the list with the key defined under `key`.
If the data type `channel` is used, the Redis `PUBLISH` command is used and means that all events
are pushed to the pub/sub mechanism of Redis. The name of the channel is the one defined under `key`.
The default value is `list`.

===== codec

Output codec configuration. If the `codec` section is missing, events will be json encoded.

See <<configuration-output-codec>> for more information.

===== host_topology

deprecated[5.0.0]

The Redis host to connect to when using topology map support. Topology map support is disabled if this option is not set.

===== password_topology

deprecated[5.0.0]

The password to use for authenticating with the Redis topology server. The default is no authentication.

===== db_topology

deprecated[5.0.0]

The Redis database number where the topology information is stored. The default is 1.

===== worker

The number of workers to use for each host configured to publish events to Redis. Use this setting along with the
`loadbalance` option. For example, if you have 2 hosts and 3 workers, in total 6 workers are started (3 for each host).

===== loadbalance

If set to true and multiple hosts or workers are configured, the output plugin load balances published events onto all
Redis hosts. If set to false, the output plugin sends all events to only one host (determined at random) and will switch
to another host if the currently selected one becomes unreachable. The default value is true.

===== timeout

The Redis connection timeout in seconds. The default is 5 seconds.

===== max_retries

The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
Some Beats, such as Filebeat, ignore the `max_retries` setting and retry until all
events are published.

Set `max_retries` to a value less than 0 to retry until all events are published.

The default is 3.

===== bulk_max_size

The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Redis request or pipeline. The default is 2048.

If the Beat sends single events, the events are collected into batches. If the
Beat publishes a large batch of events (larger than the value specified by
`bulk_max_size`), the batch is split.

Specifying a larger batch size can improve performance by lowering the overhead
of sending events. However big batch sizes can also increase processing times,
which might result in API errors, killed connections, timed-out publishing
requests, and, ultimately, lower throughput.

Setting `bulk_max_size` to values less than or equal to 0 disables buffering in
libbeat. When buffering is disabled, Beats that publish single events (such as
Packetbeat) send each event directly to Redis. Beats that publish
data in batches (such as Filebeat) send events in batches based on the spooler
size.

===== ssl

Configuration options for SSL parameters like the root CA for Redis connections
guarded by SSL proxies (for example https://www.stunnel.org[stunnel]). See
<<configuration-output-ssl>> for more information.

===== proxy_url

The URL of the SOCKS5 proxy to use when connecting to the Redis servers. The
value must be a URL with a scheme of `socks5://`. You cannot use a web proxy
because the protocol used to communicate with Redis is not based on HTTP.

If the SOCKS5 proxy server requires client authentication, you can embed
a username and password in the URL.

When using a proxy, hostnames are resolved on the proxy server instead of on the
client. You can change this behavior by setting the
<<redis-proxy-use-local-resolver,proxy_use_local_resolver>> option.

[[redis-proxy-use-local-resolver]]
===== proxy_use_local_resolver

This option determines whether Redis hostnames are resolved locally when using a proxy.
The default value is false, which means that name resolution occurs on the proxy server.

[[file-output]]
=== File Output Configuration

The File output dumps the transactions into a file where each transaction is in a JSON format.
Currently, this output is used for testing, but it can be used as input for
Logstash.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.file:
  path: "/tmp/{beatname_lc}"
  filename: {beatname_lc}
  #rotate_every_kb: 10000
  #number_of_files: 7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== File Output Options

You can specify the following options in the `file` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== enabled

The enabled config is a boolean setting to enable or disable the output. If set
to false, the output is disabled.

The default value is true.

[[path]]
===== path

The path to the directory where the generated files will be saved. This option is
mandatory.

===== filename

The name of the generated files. The default is set to the Beat name. For example, the files
generated by default for {beatname_uc} would be "{beatname_lc}", "{beatname_lc}.1", "{beatname_lc}.2", and so on.

===== rotate_every_kb

The maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, the files are
rotated. The default value is 10240 KB.

===== number_of_files

The maximum number of files to save under <<path>>. When this number of files is reached, the
oldest file is deleted, and the rest of the files are shifted from last to first. The default
is 7 files.

===== codec

Output codec configuration. If the `codec` section is missing, events will be json encoded.

See <<configuration-output-codec>> for more information.

[[console-output]]
=== Console Output Configuration

The Console output writes events in JSON format to stdout.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.console:
  pretty: true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Console Output Options

You can specify the following options in the `console` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== pretty

If `pretty` is set to true, events written to stdout will be nicely formatted. The default is false.

===== codec

Output codec configuration. If the `codec` section is missing, events will be json encoded using the `pretty` option.

See <<configuration-output-codec>> for more information.


===== enabled

The enabled config is a boolean setting to enable or disable the output. If set
to false, the output is disabled.

The default value is true.

===== bulk_max_size

The maximum number of events to buffer internally during publishing. The default is 2048.

Specifying a larger batch size may add some latency and buffering during publishing. However, for Console output, this
setting does not affect how events are published.

Setting `bulk_max_size` to 0 disables buffering in libbeat.

[[configuration-output-ssl]]

=== SSL Configuration

You can specify SSL options for any output that supports SSL.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["192.168.1.42:9200"]
  ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]
  ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
  ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== SSL Options

You can specify the following options in the `ssl` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== enabled

The `enabled` setting can be used to disable the ssl configuration by setting
it to `false`. The default value is `true`.

Note: SSL settings are disabled if either `enabled` is set to `false` or the
`ssl` section is missing.

===== certificate_authorities

The list of root certificates for server verifications. If `certificate_authorities` is empty or not set, the trusted certificate authorities of the host system are used.

[[certificate]]

===== certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

The path to the certificate for SSL client authentication. If the certificate
is not specified, client authentication is not available. The connection
might fail if the server requests client authentication. If the SSL server does not
require client authentication, the certificate will be loaded, but not requested or used
by the server.

When this option is configured, the <<certificate_key>> option is also required.

[[certificate_key]]
===== key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

The client certificate key used for client authentication. This option is required if <<certificate>> is specified.

===== key_passphrase

The passphrase used to decrypt an encrypted key stored in the configured `key` file.

===== supported_protocols

List of allowed SSL/TLS versions. If SSL/TLS server decides for protocol versions
not configured, the connection will be dropped during or after the handshake. The
setting is a list of allowed protocol versions:
`SSLv3`, `TLSv1` for TLS version 1.0, `TLSv1.0`, `TLSv1.1` and `TLSv1.2`.

The default value is `[TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]`.

===== verification_mode

This option controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host
names. The values `none` and `full` can be used. If `verification_mode` is set
to `none`, all server host names and certificates are accepted. In this mode,
TLS-based connections are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use this
option for testing only.

The default is `full`.

===== cipher_suites

The list of cipher suites to use. The first entry has the highest priority.
If this option is omitted, the Go crypto library's default
suites are used (recommended).

The following cipher suites are available:

* RSA-RC4-128-SHA (disabled by default - RC4 not recommended)
* RSA-3DES-CBC3-SHA
* RSA-AES-128-CBC-SHA
* RSA-AES-256-CBC-SHA
* ECDHE-ECDSA-RC4-128-SHA (disabled by default - RC4 not recommended)
* ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-128-CBC-SHA
* ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-256-CBC-SHA
* ECDHE-RSA-RC4-128-SHA (disabled by default- RC4 not recommended)

[[configuration-output-codec]]
=== Output Codec Configuration

For outputs that do not require a specific encoding, you can change the encoding
by using the codec configuration. You can specify either the `json` or `format`
codec. By default the `json` codec is used.

*`json.pretty`*: If `pretty` is set to true, events will be nicely formatted. The default is false.

Example configuration that uses the `json` codec with pretty printing enabled to write events to the console:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.console:
  codec.json:
    pretty: true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*`format.string`*: Configurable format string used to create a custom formatted message.

Example configurable that uses the `format` codec to print the events timestamp and message field to console:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.console:
  codec.format:
    string: '%{[@timestamp]} %{[message]}'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
