. If you've secured Elasticsearch and Kibana, you need to specify credentials
in the config file before you run the commands that set up and start
{beatname_uc}. For example:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["myEShost:9200"]
  username: "elastic"
  password: "elastic"
setup.kibana:
  host: "mykibanahost:5601"
  username: "elastic" <1>
  password: "elastic"
----
<1> The `username` and `password` settings for Kibana are optional. If you don't
specify credentials for Kibana, {beatname_uc} uses the `username` and `password`
specified for the Elasticsearch output.
