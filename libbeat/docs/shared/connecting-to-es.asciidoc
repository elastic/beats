Connections to {es} and {kib} are required to set up {beatname_uc}.

Set the connection information in +{beatname_lc}.yml+. To locate the file, see
<<directory-layout>>. 

include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/set-connection-widget.asciidoc[]

To learn more about required roles and privileges, see
<<feature-roles>>.

NOTE: {beatname_uc} supports other <<configuring-output,outputs>>,
ifndef::no-output-logstash[]
such as {ls},
endif::no-output-logstash[]
but typically you'll send events directly to {es}.
