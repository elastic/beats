To open the dashboards:

. Launch {kib}:

include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/open-kibana-widget.asciidoc[]
--

. In the side navigation, click *Discover*. To see {beatname_uc} data, make
sure the predefined +{beatname_lc}-*+ data view is selected.

TIP: If you don’t see data in {kib}, try changing the time filter to a larger
range. By default, {kib} shows the last 15 minutes.

. In the side navigation, click *Dashboard*, then select the dashboard that you
want to open.

The dashboards are provided as examples. We recommend that you
