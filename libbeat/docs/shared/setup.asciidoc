{beatname_uc} comes with preconfigured assets for visualizing and parsing your
data. To set up these assets, the user specified in +{beatname_lc}.yml+ 
requires extra privileges. For more information, see
<<privileges-to-setup-beats>>.

To set up {beatname_uc}, from the installation directory, run:

include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/setup-widget.asciidoc[]

The <<setup-command,`setup`>> command loads the recommended index template for
writing to {es} and deploys the sample dashboards (if available) for visualizing
the data in {kib}. This is a one-time setup step. 

The `-e` flag is optional and sends output to standard error instead of syslog.
