{beatname_uc} comes with predefined assets for visualizing and parsing your
data. To load these assets:

. Make sure the user specified in +{beatname_lc}.yml+ has the
<<privileges-to-setup-beats>>,privileges needed to set up {beatname_uc}>>.

. From the installation directory, run:
+
include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/setup-widget.asciidoc[]

This command loads the recommended index template for
writing to {es}
ifndef::no_dashboards[]
and deploys the sample dashboards (if available) for visualizing
the data in {kib}
endif::no_dashboards[]
. This is a one-time setup step. 

The `-e` flag is optional and sends output to standard error instead of syslog.
