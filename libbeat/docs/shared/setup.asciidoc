{beatname_uc} comes with predefined assets for visualizing and parsing your
data. To load these assets:

. Make sure the user specified in +{beatname_lc}.yml+ has the
<<privileges-to-setup-beats,privileges needed to set up {beatname_uc}>>.

. From the installation directory, run:
+
--
include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/setup-widget.asciidoc[]
--
+
`-e` is optional and sends output to standard error instead of syslog.
