You can use the {stack} {monitor-features} to gain insight into the health of
ifndef::apm-server[]
{beatname_uc} instances running in your environment. 
endif::[]
ifdef::apm-server[]
{beatname_uc}. 
endif::[]

To monitor {beatname_uc}, make sure monitoring is enabled on your {es} cluster,
then configure the method used to collect {beatname_uc} metrics. You can use one
of following methods:

* <<monitoring-internal-collection,Internal collection>> - Internal
collectors send monitoring data directly to your monitoring cluster.
ifndef::serverless[]
* <<monitoring-metricbeat-collection, {metricbeat} collection>> - 
{metricbeat} collects monitoring data from your {beatname_uc} instance
and sends it directly to your monitoring cluster.
endif::[]
* <<monitoring-internal-collection-legacy,Legacy collection (deprecated)>> - 
Legacy collectors send monitoring data to your production cluster.
