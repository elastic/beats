= Monitoring {beatname_uc}

[partintro]

{monitoring} enables you to easily monitor {beatname_uc} from {kib}. For more
information, see
{xpack-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the Elastic Stack] and
{kibana-ref}/beats-page.html[Beats Monitoring Metrics].

To configure {beatname_uc} to collect and send monitoring metrics:

. Create a user that has appropriate authority to send system-level monitoring
data to {es}. For example, you can use the built-in `logstash_system` user or
assign the built-in `logstash_system` role to another user. For more
information, see
{xpack-ref}/setting-up-authentication.html[Setting Up User Authentication] and
{xpack-ref}/built-in-roles.html[Built-in Roles].

. Add the `xpack.monitoring` settings in the {beatname_uc} configuration file.
If you configured {es} output and you want to use the same {es} production
cluster and credentials, you can specify the following minimal configuration
options:
+
--
[source, yml]
--------------------
xpack.monitoring:
  enabled: true
  elasticsearch:
--------------------

Otherwise, you must specify additional configuration options. For example:

[source, yml]
--------------------
xpack.monitoring:
  enabled: true
  elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["https://example.com:9200", "https://example2.com:9200"]
    username: elastic
    password: changeme
--------------------

. {kibana-ref}/monitoring-xpack-kibana.html[Configure monitoring in {kib}].

. To verify your monitoring configuration, point your web browser at your {kib}
host, and select Monitoring from the side navigation. Metrics reported from
{beatname_uc} should be visible in the Beats section. When {security} is enabled,
to view the monitoring dashboards you must log in to {kib} as a user who has the
`kibana_user` and `monitoring_user` roles.
