You can use the {stack} {monitor-features} to gain insight into the health of
ifndef::apm-server[]
{beatname_uc} instances running in your environment. 
endif::[]
ifdef::apm-server[]
{beatname_uc}. 
endif::[]

To monitor {beatname_uc}, make sure monitoring is enabled on your {es} cluster,
then configure the method used to collect {beatname_uc} metrics. You can use one
of following methods:

* <<monitoring-internal-collection,Internal collection>> - Internal
collectors send monitoring data directly to your monitoring cluster.
* <<monitoring-internal-collection-legacy,Legacy internal collection (deprecated)>> - 
Legacy internal collectors send monitoring data to your production cluster.
