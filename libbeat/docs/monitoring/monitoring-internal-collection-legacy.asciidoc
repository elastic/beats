== Use legacy internal collection to send monitoring data
++++
<titleabbrev>Legacy internal collection (deprecated)</titleabbrev>
++++

deprecated[7.2.0]

In {beatname_uc} version 7.1 and earlier, you configured internal collectors
that sent monitoring data to the production cluster, which would either index
the data locally, or forward the data to a dedicated monitoring cluster via HTTP
exporters.

Starting in {beatname_uc} version 7.2, the legacy settings for internal
collection are deprecated and will be removed in version 8.0.0. Instead of
sending monitoring data to your production cluster, it's recommended that you
use the configuration described under
<<monitoring-internal-collection,internal collection>> to route
monitoring data directly to your monitoring cluster.

ifndef::serverless[]
Or as an alternative to internal collection, use
<<monitoring-metricbeat-collection>>.
