== Use legacy collection to send monitoring data
++++
<titleabbrev>Use legacy collection (deprecated)</titleabbrev>
++++

deprecated[7.2.0]

In {beatname_uc} version 7.1 and earlier, you configured internal collectors
that sent monitoring data to the production cluster, which would either index
the data locally, or forward the data to a dedicated monitoring cluster via HTTP
exporters.

Starting in {beatname_uc} version 7.2, legacy collection settings are deprecated
and will be removed in version 8.0.0. Instead of sending monitoring data to your
production cluster, it's recommended that you use the configuration described
under
<<monitoring-internal-collection,internal collection>> to route
monitoring data directly to your monitoring cluster.

ifndef::serverless[]
Or as an alternative to internal collection, use
<<monitoring-metricbeat-collection>>.
