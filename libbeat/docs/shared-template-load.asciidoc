NOTE: A connection to {es} is required to load the index template. If
the output is not {es} (or {ess}), you must
<<load-template-manually,load the template manually>>. 
endif::[]

In {es}, {ref}/indices-templates.html[index templates] are used to define
settings and mappings that determine how fields are analyzed.

The recommended index template file for {beatname_uc} is installed by the
{beatname_uc} packages. If you accept the default configuration in the
+{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file, {beatname_uc} loads the template automatically
after successfully connecting to {es}. If the template already exists,
it's not overwritten unless you configure {beatname_uc} to do so.

Skip to the next step if you want to use the default index template. 

To use a custom different index template, read <<{beatname_lc}-template>>.
