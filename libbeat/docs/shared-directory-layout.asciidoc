=== Directory Layout

The directory layout of an installation is as follows:

[cols="<h,<,<m,<m",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Type | Description | Default Location | Config Option
| home | Home of the {beatname_uc} installation. | | path.home
| bin  | The location for the binary files. | {path.home}/bin |
| conf | The location for configuration files. | {path.home} | path.conf
| data | The location for persistent data files. | {path.home}/data| path.data
| logs | The location for the logs created by {beatname_uc}. | {path.home}/logs | path.logs
|=======================================================================

You can change these settings by using CLI flags or setting <<configuration-path,path options>> in the configuration
file.

==== Default paths

{beatname_uc} uses the following default paths unless you explicitly change them. 

[float]
===== deb and rpm
[cols="<h,<,<m",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Type | Description | Location
| home | Home of the {beatname_uc} installation. | /usr/share/{beatname_lc}
| bin  | The location for the binary files. | /usr/share/{beatname_lc}/bin
| conf | The location for configuration files. | /etc/{beatname_lc}
| data | The location for persistent data files. | /var/lib/{beatname_lc}
| logs | The location for the logs created by {beatname_uc}. | /var/log/{beatname_lc}
|=======================================================================

For the deb and rpm distributions, these paths are set in the init script or in
the systemd unit file.  Make sure that you start the {beatname_uc} service by using
the preferred operating system method (init scripts or `systemctl`).
Otherwise the paths might be set incorrectly.

[float]
===== zip, tar.gz, and tgz
[cols="<h,<,<m",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Type | Description | Location
| home | Home of the {beatname_uc} installation. | {extract.path}
| bin  | The location for the binary files. | {extract.path}/bin
| conf | The location for configuration files. | {extract.path}
| data | The location for persistent data files. | {extract.path}/data
| logs | The location for the logs created by {beatname_uc}. | {extract.path}/logs
|=======================================================================

For the zip, tar.gz and tgz distributions, these paths are based on the location of the
extracted binary file. This means that if you start {beatname_uc} with the following simple command,
all paths are set correctly:


["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./{beatname_lc}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
