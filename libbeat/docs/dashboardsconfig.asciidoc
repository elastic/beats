=== Dashboards

beta[]

The `dashboards` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file contains options
for automatically loading the sample Beats dashboards. Automatic dashboard
loading is disabled by default, but can be enabled either from the configuration
file or by using the `-setup` CLI flag.

If dashboard loading is enabled, {beatname_uc} attempts to configure Kibana by
writing directly in the Elasticsearch index for the Kibana configuration (by
default, `.kibana`). To connect to Elasticsearch, {beatname_uc} uses the
settings defined in the Elasticsearch output. If the Elasticsearch output is
not configured or not enabled, {beatname_uc} will stop with an error. Dashboard
loading is only attempted at Beat startup. If Elasticsearch is not available when
the Beat starts, {beatname_uc} will stop with an error.

Here is an example configuration:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dashboards.enabled: true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Dashboards Loading Options

You can specify the following options in the `dashboards` section of the
+{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== enabled

If this option is set to true, {beatname_uc} loads the sample Kibana dashboards
automatically on startup. If no other options are set, the dashboard are loaded
from the local `kibana` directory in the home path of the installation.

To load dashboards from a different location, you can configure one of the
following options: <<url-option,`url`>>, or <<file-option,`file`>>.

[[directory-option]]
===== directory

The directory that contains the dashboards to load. The default is the `kibana`
folder in the home path.

[[url-option]]
===== url

The URL to use for downloading the dashboard archive. If this option
is set, {beatname_uc} downloads the dashboard archive from the specified URL
instead of using the local directory.


[[file-option]]
===== file

The file archive (zip file) that contains the dashboards to load. If this option
is set, {beatname_uc} looks for a dashboard archive in the specified path
instead of using the local directory.

===== beat

In case the archive contains the dashboards for multiple Beats, this setting
lets you select the Beat for which you want to load dashboards. To load all the
dashboards in the archive, set this option to an empty string. The default is
+"{beatname_lc}"+.

===== kibana_index

The name of the Kibana index to use for setting the configuration. The default
is `".kibana"`

===== index

The Elasticsearch index name. This setting overwrites the index name defined
in the dashboards and index pattern. Example: `"testbeat-*"`
