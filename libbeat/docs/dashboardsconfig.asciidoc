[[configuration-dashboards]]
== Load the Kibana dashboards

{beatname_uc} comes packaged with example Kibana dashboards, visualizations,
and searches for visualizing {beatname_uc} data in Kibana.

To load the dashboards, you can either enable dashboard loading in the
`setup.dashboards` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file, or you can
run the `setup` command. Dashboard loading is disabled by default.

When dashboard loading is enabled, {beatname_uc} uses the Kibana API to load the
sample dashboards. Dashboard loading is only attempted when {beatname_uc} starts up.
If Kibana is not available at startup, {beatname_uc} will stop with an error.

To enable dashboard loading, add the following setting to the config file:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
setup.dashboards.enabled: true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Configuration options

You can specify the following options in the `setup.dashboards` section of the
+{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

[float]
==== `setup.dashboards.enabled`

If this option is set to true, {beatname_uc} loads the sample Kibana dashboards
from the local `kibana` directory in the home path of the {beatname_uc} installation.

NOTE: When dashboard loading is enabled, {beatname_uc} overwrites any existing
dashboards that match the names of the dashboards you are loading. This happens
every time {beatname_uc} starts. 

If no other options are set, the dashboard are loaded
from the local `kibana` directory in the home path of the {beatname_uc} installation.
To load dashboards from a different location, you can configure one of the
following options: <<directory-option,`setup.dashboards.directory`>>,
<<url-option,`setup.dashboards.url`>>, or
<<file-option,`setup.dashboards.file`>>.

[float]
[[directory-option]]
==== `setup.dashboards.directory`

The directory that contains the dashboards to load. The default is the `kibana`
folder in the home path.

[float]
[[url-option]]
==== `setup.dashboards.url`

The URL to use for downloading the dashboard archive. If this option
is set, {beatname_uc} downloads the dashboard archive from the specified URL
instead of using the local directory.

[float]
[[file-option]]
==== `setup.dashboards.file`

The file archive (zip file) that contains the dashboards to load. If this option
is set, {beatname_uc} looks for a dashboard archive in the specified path
instead of using the local directory.

[float]
==== `setup.dashboards.beat`

In case the archive contains the dashboards for multiple Beats, this setting
lets you select the Beat for which you want to load dashboards. To load all the
dashboards in the archive, set this option to an empty string. The default is
+"{beatname_lc}"+.

[float]
==== `setup.dashboards.kibana_index`

The name of the Kibana index to use for setting the configuration. The default
is `".kibana"`


[float]
==== `setup.dashboards.index`

The Elasticsearch index name. This setting overwrites the index name defined
in the dashboards and index pattern. Example: `"testbeat-*"`

NOTE: This setting only works for Kibana 6.0 and newer.

[float]
==== `setup.dashboards.always_kibana`

Force loading of dashboards using the Kibana API without querying Elasticsearch for the version
The default is `false`.

[float]
==== `setup.dashboards.retry.enabled`

If this option is set to true, and Kibana is not reachable at the time when dashboards are loaded,
 {beatname_uc} will retry to reconnect to Kibana instead of exiting with an error. Disabled by default.

[float]
==== `setup.dashboards.retry.interval`

Duration interval between Kibana connection retries. Defaults to 1 second.

[float]
==== `setup.dashboards.retry.maximum`

Maximum number of retries before exiting with an error. Set to 0 for unlimited retrying.
Default is unlimited.
