=== Dashboards Configuration

beta[]

The `dashboards` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file contains options
for the automatic loading of the sample Beats dashboards. The loading of the
dashboards is disabled by default, but can be enabled either from the configuration
file or by using the `-setup` CLI flag.

If dashboard loading is enabled, {beatname_uc} attempts to configure Kibana by
writing directly in the Elasticsearch index for the Kibana configuration (by
default, `.kibana`). To connect to Elasticsearch, it uses the settings defined
in the Eleasticsearch output. If the Elasticsearch output is not configured or
not enabled, {beatname_uc} will stop with an error. Loading the dashboards is
only attempted at the Beat start, if Elasticsearch is not available when the
Beat starts, {beatname_uc} will stop with an error.

==== Dashboards Loading Options

You can specify the following options in the `dashboards` section of the
+{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== enabled

If enabled, load the sample Kibana dashboards on startup. If no other options
are set, the dashboards archive is downloaded from the elastic.co website.

===== url

The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL has a
value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
website.

===== directory

The directory from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead of the URL
when it has a value.

===== file

The file archive (zip file) from where to read the dashboards. It is used
instead of the URL when it has a value.

===== snapshot

If this option is set to true, the snapshot URL is used instead of the default
URL.

===== snapshot_url

The URL from where to download the snapshot version of the dashboards. By
default this has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version.

===== beat

In case the archive contains the dashboards from multiple Beats, this lets you
select which one to load. You can load all the dashboards in the archive by
setting this to the empty string. The default is "{beatname_lc}".

===== kibana_index

The name of the Kibana index to use for setting the configuration. Default is
".kibana"

===== index

The Elasticsearch index name. This overwrites the index name defined in the
dashboards and index pattern. Example: "testbeat-*"
