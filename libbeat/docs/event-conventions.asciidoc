=== Event conventions

==== Naming conventions

For the field names, the Beats follow the naming conventions below:

- All fields must be lower case
- Snake case for combining words
- Group related fields in sub documents, which means using the . notation. Groups are mostly described by common prefixes.
- Prevent namespace duplication. If connections appears in the namespace, it's not needed in the sub document
- Do not use complex abbreviations. A list of standardised abbreviations can be found below.
- Organise the documents from the general to the details, which allows namespacing. The type should always be last, like .pct.
- If two fields are the same but with different units, remove the less granular one
- In case the value correlates with the name of a nested document, use value inside the document
- Do not use . in the names
- Use singular and plural properly for the fields. Example: sec_per_request vs open_requests
- Use singular names for metricsets. It easier to read the event created: system.process.load = 0.3


The goal is to have a similar experience across all metrics.
