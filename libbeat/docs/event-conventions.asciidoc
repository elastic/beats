=== Naming Conventions

When creating events, use the following conventions for field names and abbreviations.

[[field-names]]
==== Field Names

Use the following naming conventions for field names:

- All fields must be lower case.
- Use snake case (underscores) for combining words.
- Group related fields into subdocuments, which means using the dot (.) notation. Groups are mostly described by common prefixes. 
//QUESTION: I am not sure what you mean by common prefixes here. Perhaps examples would help?
- Prevent namespace duplication. If connections appears in the namespace, it's not needed in the sub document 
//QUESTION: I don't understand what you mean here. Can you clarify or give an example?
- Do not use complex abbreviations. See <<abbreviations>>.
//QUESTION: What do we mean by complex abbreviations? Can we just tell people to use standard abbreviations and avoid using abbreviations that aren't commonly known?
- Organise the documents from general to specific to allow for namespacing. The type, such as `.pct`, should always be last. For example, `system.core.user.pct`
- If two fields are the same, but with different units, remove the less granular one.
//QUESTION: What if we want to  provide a less granular view, too? It would be useful to provide an example here.
- In case the value correlates with the name of a nested document, use value inside the document
//QUESTON: I don't understand what you mean here. Can you clarify?
- Do not use dots (.) in names. 
//QUESTION: Wouldn't it be clearer to say, "Do not use dots (.) in individual field names. Dots are reserved for grouping related fields into subdocuments." Is that why you have this restriction?
- Use singular and plural names properly to reflect the field content. For example: `sec_per_request` vs `open_requests`. 
//QUESTION: I wonder if we should remove this rule since we sort of violate it ourselves (especially with our  abbreviations).
- Use singular names for metricsets. It's easier to read the event created as: `system.process.load = 0.3`. The goal is to have a similar experience across all metrics. 
//QUESTION: This seems really specific to metricbeat. Does it really belong in the general dev guide? 

[[abbreviations]]
==== Standard Abbrevations

Here is a list of standardised words and units that are used across all Beats:

//QUESTION: Are we saying here to use the word/abbreviation on the left in favor of the one on the right? If so, we need to make this more clear. Maybe we could have two columns Use... Instead of...

* avg: average
* connection: conn 
* count:
* day: days, d
* max: maximum
* min: minimum
* pct: percentage
* request: req
* sec: seconds, second, s
* ms: millisecond, millis
* mb: megabytes
* msg: message
* ns: nanoseconds
* norm: normalized
* us: microseconds
