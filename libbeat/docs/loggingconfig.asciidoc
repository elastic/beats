=== Logging (Optional)

The `logging` section contains options for configuring the Beats logging output.
The logging system can write logs to syslog or rotate log files. If logging is
not explicitly configured, file output is used on Windows systems, and syslog
output is used on Linux and OS X.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
logging:
  level: warning

  # enable file rotation with default configuration
  to_files: true

  # do not log to syslog
  to_syslog: false

  files:
    path: /var/log/mybeat
    name: mybeat.log
    keepfiles: 7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the logging system, the logging output configuration can be
modified from the command line.

==== Logging Options

You can specify the following options under the `logging` section:

===== to_syslog

Sends all logging output to syslog if enabled. For non-Windows systems, the default
value is true.

===== to_files

Writes all logging output to files subject to file rotation. On Windows systems, the
default value is true.

===== level

Minimum log level. One of debug, info, warning, error or critical. If debug is
used, but no selectors are configured, the `*` selector will be used.
The default log level is error.

===== selectors

The list of debugging-only selector tags used by different Beats components. Use `*`
to enable debug output for all components. For example add `publish` to display
all the debug messages related to event publishing. When starting the Beat,
selectors can be overwritten using the `-d` command line option (`-d` also sets
the debug log level).

===== files.path

The directory that log files are written to. For Windows
systems the default path is `C:\ProgramData\<beat-name>\Logs`. The default for
non-Windows systems is `/var/log/<beat-name>`.

===== files.name

The name of the file that logs are written to. By default, the name of the Beat
is used.

===== files.rotateeverybytes

The maximum size of a log file. If the limit is reached, a new log file is generated.
The default size limit is 10485760 (10 MB).

===== files.keepfiles

The number of most recent rotated log files to keep on disk. Older files are
deleted during log rotation. The default value is 7. The `keepfiles` options has to be
in the range of 2 to 1024 files.

==== Logging Format

The logging format is different for each logging type:

* to syslog: Syslog adds the timestamp itself.

* to file: RFC 3339 format is used for the timestamp: `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00 WARN log-message`. The format includes the timezone followed by the logging level.

* to stderr: UTC format is used for the timestamp: `2015/11/12 09:03:37.369262
geolite.go:52: WARN log-message`. The format includes the UTC timestamp with
the milliseconds, then the name of the caller that sent the log entry followed
by the logging level. This option should be used mainly for debugging.
