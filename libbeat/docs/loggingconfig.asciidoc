=== Logging Configuration

The `logging` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file contains options
for configuring the Beats logging output. The logging system can write logs to
syslog or rotate log files. If logging is not explicitly configured, file output
is used on Windows systems, and syslog output is used on Linux and OS X.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
logging.level: warning

# enable file rotation with default configuration
logging.to_files: true

# do not log to syslog
logging.to_syslog: false

logging.files:
  path: /var/log/mybeat
  name: mybeat.log
  keepfiles: 7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the logging system, the logging output configuration can be
modified from the command line.

==== Logging Options

You can specify the following options in the `logging` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

===== to_syslog

If enabled, sends all logging output to syslog. The default
value is false. 

===== to_files

Writes all logging output to files subject to file rotation. The
default value is true.

===== level

Minimum log level. One of debug, info, warning, error or critical. If debug is
used, but no selectors are configured, the `*` selector will be used.
The default log level is "info".

===== selectors

The list of debugging-only selector tags used by different Beats components. Use `*`
to enable debug output for all components. For example add `publish` to display
all the debug messages related to event publishing. When starting the Beat,
selectors can be overwritten using the `-d` command line option (`-d` also sets
the debug log level).

===== metrics.enabled

If enabled, {beatname_uc} periodically logs its internal metrics that have
changed in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the
value at the beginning of the period is logged. The default is true.

Here is an example log line:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/07/04 12:16:10.821047 logp.go:194: INFO Non-zero metrics in the last 30s:  libbeatEsPublishedAndAckedEvents=18 libbeatEsPublishWriteBytes=10045
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that we currently offer no backwards compatible guarantees for the internal
metrics and for this reason they are also not documented.


===== metrics.period

The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.

===== files.path

The directory that log files are written to. The default is the logs path. See the
<<directory-layout>> section for details.

===== files.name

The name of the file that logs are written to. By default, the name of the Beat
is used.

===== files.rotateeverybytes

The maximum size of a log file. If the limit is reached, a new log file is generated.
The default size limit is 10485760 (10 MB).

===== files.keepfiles

The number of most recent rotated log files to keep on disk. Older files are
deleted during log rotation. The default value is 7. The `keepfiles` options has to be
in the range of 2 to 1024 files.

==== Logging Format

The logging format is different for each logging type:

* to syslog: Syslog adds the timestamp itself.

* to file: RFC 3339 format is used for the timestamp: `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00 WARN log-message`. The format includes the timezone followed by the logging level.

* to stderr: UTC format is used for the timestamp: `2015/11/12 09:03:37.369262
geolite.go:52: WARN log-message`. The format includes the UTC timestamp with
the milliseconds, then the name of the caller that sent the log entry followed
by the logging level. This option should be used mainly for debugging.
