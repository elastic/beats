=== Breaking changes in 7.4

This section discusses the main changes that you need to be aware of to
migrate Beats to version 7.4. {see-relnotes}

//NOTE: The notable-breaking-changes tagged regions are re-used in the
//Installation and Upgrade Guide

//tag::notable-breaking-changes[]

[float]
==== Golang version update

The Beats platform has been updated to use Golang 1.12.7.

// REVIEWERS: Is the above statement correct (taken from the relnotes)? The 
// libbeat/docs/version.asciidoc file has the golang version set to 1.12.9.

[float]
==== {auditbeat} `system` module changes

The `socket` dataset in the `system` module now uses Kprobes for finer-grained
monitoring and UDP support. For more information, see
{auditbeat-ref}/auditbeat-dataset-system-socket.html[System socket dataset].

[float]
==== {filebeat} field name changes

Some field names exported by the `asa` fileset in the `cisco` module have
changed:

[options="header"]
|====
|Old field                 |New field
|`log.original`            |`event.original`
|`cisco.asa.list_id`       |`cisco.asa.rule_name`
|====


//REVIEWERS: Do we want to mention the functionbeat deployment/pkg changes here?
//sounds like there's been some discussion and maybe it's more of a feature
//than a breaking change. WDYT?
