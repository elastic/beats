== HTTPS and Basic Authentication

To secure the communication between a Beat and Elasticsearch, you can use HTTPS
and basic authentication. Here is a sample configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
elasticsearch:
  username: packetbeat <1>
  password: verysecret <2>
  protocol: https <3>
  hosts: ["elasticsearch.example.com:9200"] <4>
  save_topology: true
----
<1> The username to use for authenticating to Elasticsearch.
<2> The password to use for authenticating to Elasticsearch.
<3> This setting enables the HTTPS protocol.
<4> The IP and port of the Elasticsearch nodes.


Elasticsearch doesn't have built-in basic authentication, but you can achieve it
either by using a web proxy or by using the
https://www.elastic.co/products/shield[Shield] commercial plugin.

The Beat verifies the validity of the server certificates and only accepts trusted
certificates. Creating a correct SSL/TLS infrastructure is outside the scope of
this document, but a good guide to follow is the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/shield/current/certificate-authority.html[Running a Certificate Authority]
appendix from the Shield guide.

By default the Beat uses the list of trusted certificate authorities from the
operating system where the Beat is running. You can configure a Beat to use a specific list of
CA certificates instead of the list from the OS. Here is an example:

[source,yaml]
----
elasticsearch:
  username: packetbeat
  password: verysecret
  protocol: https
  hosts: ["elasticsearch.example.com:9200"]
  save_topology: true
  certificate_authorities: <1>
    - /etc/pki/my_root_ca.pem
    - /etc/pki/my_other_ca.pem
----
<1> The list of CA certificates to trust


NOTE: For any given connection, the SSL/TLS certificates must have a subject
that matches the value specified for `hosts`, or the TLS handshake fails.
For example, if you specify `hosts: ["foobar:9200"]`, the certificate MUST
include `foobar` in the subject (`CN=foobar`) or as a subject alternative name
(SAN). Make sure the hostname resolves to the correct IP address. If no DNS is available, then
you can associate the IP address with your hostname in `/etc/hosts`
(on Unix systems).
