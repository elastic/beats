==== Set up the dashboards

{beatname_uc} comes packaged with example Kibana dashboards, visualizations,
and searches for visualizing {beatname_uc} data in Kibana. Before you can use
the dashboards, you need to run the `setup` command to create the index
pattern, +{beatname_lc}-*+, and load the dashboards into the Kibana index.

NOTE: Starting with Beats 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration. You should have configured the
endpoint in <<{beatname_lc}-configuration>>. If you didn't, configure it now.

To set up the Kibana dashboards for {beatname_uc}:

ifdef::allplatforms[]

*deb, rpm, and mac:*

From the directory where you installed {beatname_uc}, run:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./{beatname_lc} setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ifeval::["{beatname_lc}"!="auditbeat"]

*docker:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
docker run {dockerimage} setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

*win:*

endif::allplatforms[]

Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon
and select *Run As Administrator*). If you are running Windows XP, you may need
to download and install PowerShell.

From the PowerShell prompt, change to the directory where you installed {beatname_uc},
and run:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > {beatname_lc} setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Opening the Dashboards in Kibana

After loading the dashboards, launch the Kibana web interface by pointing your browser
to port 5601. For example, http://127.0.0.1:5601[http://127.0.0.1:5601].

On the *Discover* page, make sure that the predefined +{beatname_lc}-*+ index
pattern is selected to see {beatname_uc} data.
