=== Importing the Beats Dashboards

Kibana has a large set of visualization types that you can combine to create
the perfect dashboards for your needs. But this flexibility can be a bit
overwhelming at the beginning, so we have created some sample dashboards to get you
started and to demonstrate what is possible based on the Beats data.

Each Beat comes packaged with the `scripts/import_dashboards` script that you can use to import the example dashboards,
visualizations, and searches for that Beat. The script also creates index patterns, such as 
`packetbeat-*` for Packetbeat, `metricbeat-*` for Metricbeat, and so on. 


The command line options of the script, together with more examples, are available under the
<<import-dashboards,import_dashboards>> section.

Use the following command to import the Kibana dashboards for any of the Elastic Beats:

*deb, rpm, and mac:*

From the directory where you installed the Beat, run the `import_dashboards` script. 

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./scripts/import_dashboards
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On deb and rpm, the `scripts` folder is located under the home path, which is `/usr/share/{beat_name}/` unless you change it.

By default, the script assumes that you are running Elasticsearch on `127.0.0.1:9200`. Use the `-es` option
to specify a different location. For example: 

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./scripts/import_dashboards -es http://192.168.33.60:9200 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The username and password to use for Elasticsearch authentication. There are a few ways to pass in the username and password. For example:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./scripts/import_dashboards -es https://xyz.found.io -user user -pass password <1>
$ ./scripts/import_dashboards -es https://xyz.found.io -user admin -pass $(cat ~/pass-file) <2> 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Specify the username and password as options.
<2> Use a file to avoid polluting the bash history with the password.


*win:*

Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon
and select *Run As Administrator*). If you are running Windows XP, you may need
to download and install PowerShell. 

From the directory where you installed the Beat, run the `import_dashboards` script:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > scripts\import_dashboards
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the script assumes that you are running Elasticsearch on `127.0.0.1:9200`. Use the `-es` option to specify a different location. For example: 


["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > scripts\import_dashboards -es http://192.168.33.60:9200
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If script execution is disabled on your system, you need to set the execution policy for the current session to
allow the script to run. For example: `PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File scripts\import_dashboards -es http://192.168.33.60:9200`.


The username and password to use for authentication:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > scripts\import_dashboards -es https://xyz.found.io -user user -pass password
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Please see <<import-dashboards,import Kibana dashboards>> for more details about the `import_dashboards` script.

=== Opening the Beats Dashboards in Kibana

After <<load-kibana-dashboards,importing the Beats dashboards>>,
launch the Kibana web interface by pointing your browser
to port 5601. For example, http://127.0.0.1:5601[http://127.0.0.1:5601].

If Kibana shows a `No default index pattern` warning, you must select or create
an index pattern to continue. To resolve the issue, select one of the
predefined index patterns and set it as the default.

[NOTE]

====
There is a known issue in the 5.0.0-alpha4 release of Kibana that affects

installations of Kibana 5.0.0-alpha4 that donâ€™t yet have any indices defined. 
To resolve this error, see the "Known issue and workaround" section
https://www.elastic.co/blog/beats-5-0-0-alpha4-released[here].
