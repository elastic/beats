==== Importing the Dashboards

{beatname_uc} comes packaged with the `scripts/import_dashboards` script that you can use to import the example dashboards,
visualizations, and searches for {beatname_uc}. The script also creates an index pattern,
+{beatname_lc}-*+, for {beatname_uc}. 

The steps in this section show how to import {beatname_uc} dashboards. You may want to import dashboards for more than
one Beat or specify import options that aren't described here. See {libbeat}/[Importing Existing Beat Dashboards]
in the _Beats Platform Reference_ for a full list of command-line options.

To import the Kibana dashboards for {beatname_uc}:

ifdef::allplatforms[]

*deb, rpm, and mac:*

From the directory where you installed {beatname_uc}, run the `import_dashboards` script. 

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./scripts/import_dashboards
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On deb and rpm, the `scripts` folder is located under the home path, which is +/usr/share/{beatname_lc}/+ unless you change it.

By default, the script assumes that you are running Elasticsearch on `127.0.0.1:9200`. Use the `-es` option
to specify a different location. For example: 

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./scripts/import_dashboards -es http://192.168.33.60:9200 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the `-user` option to specify the username and password to use for Elasticsearch authentication. There are a few ways to pass
in the username and password. For example:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
./scripts/import_dashboards -es https://xyz.found.io -user user -pass password <1>
./scripts/import_dashboards -es https://xyz.found.io -user admin -pass $(cat ~/pass-file) <2> 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Specify the username and password as options.
<2> Use a file to avoid polluting the bash history with the password.

*win:*

endif::allplatforms[]

Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon
and select *Run As Administrator*). If you are running Windows XP, you may need
to download and install PowerShell. 

From the directory where you installed {beatname_uc}, run the `import_dashboards.exe` script:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > scripts\import_dashboards.exe
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the script assumes that you are running Elasticsearch on `127.0.0.1:9200`. Use the `-es` option to specify a different location. For example:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > scripts\import_dashboards.exe -es http://192.168.33.60:9200
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If script execution is disabled on your system, you need to set the execution policy for the current session to
allow the script to run. For example: `PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File scripts\import_dashboards.exe -es http://192.168.33.60:9200`.


Use the `-user` option to specify the username and password to use for Elasticsearch authentication:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > scripts\import_dashboards.exe -es https://xyz.found.io -user user -pass password
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Opening the Dashboards in Kibana

After importing the dashboards, launch the Kibana web interface by pointing your browser
to port 5601. For example, http://127.0.0.1:5601[http://127.0.0.1:5601].

If Kibana shows a `No default index pattern` warning, you must select or create
an index pattern to continue. To resolve the issue, select the
predefined +{beatname_lc}-*+ index pattern and set it as the default.

To open the loaded dashboards, go to the *Dashboard* page and click *Open*.
Select the dashboard that you want to open.
