=== Loading the Beats Dashboards

Kibana has a large set of visualization types that you can combine to create
the perfect dashboards for your needs. But this flexibility can be a bit
overwhelming at the beginning, so we have created some sample dashboards to get you
started and to demonstrate what is possible based on the Beats data.

Each Beat comes packaged with a script that you can use to import the example dashboards,
visualizations, and searches for that Beat. The script also creates index patterns, such as 
`packetbeat-*` for Packetbeat, `metricbeat-*` for Metricbeat, and so on. 

Use the following commands to run the script:

*deb, rpm, and mac:*

From the directory where you installed the Beat, change to the `kibana` directory and run the `import_dashboards.sh` script. For example:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd kibana/ 
./import_dashboards.sh
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On deb and rpm, the `kibana` folder is located under the home path, which is `/usr/share/beat_name/` unless you change it.

By default, the script assumes that you are running Elasticsearch on `127.0.0.1:9200`. Use the `-url` option
to specify a different location. For example: `./import_dashboards.sh -url http://192.168.33.60:9200`. To specify a Kibana index pattern or pass in user credentials, see <<dashboard-load-options>>.

*win:*

. Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon
and select *Run As Administrator*). If you are running Windows XP, you may need
to download and install PowerShell. 

. From the directory where you installed the Beat, run the following commands to load the dashboards:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > cd kibana
PS > .\import_dashboards.ps1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
By default, the script assumes that you are running Elasticsearch on `127.0.0.1:9200`. Use the `-url` option
to specify a different location. For example: `.\import_dashboards.ps1 -url http://192.168.33.60:9200`. To specify a Kibana index pattern or pass in user credentials, see <<dashboard-load-options>>.
+
NOTE: If script execution is disabled on your system, you need to set the execution policy for the current session to allow the script to run. For example: `PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File .\import_dashboards.ps1 -url http://192.168.33.60:9200`.

=== Other Dashboard Load Options
When you load the Beats dashboards, you can also specify:

* The Kibana index pattern where you want to load the dashboards in Elasticsearch. For example:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./import_dashboards.sh -url http://test.com:9200 -index .kibana_env
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* The username and password to use for authentication. There are a few ways to pass in the username and password. For example:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./import_dashboards.sh -url https://xyz.found.io -u user:password <1>

./import_dashboards.sh -url https://xyz.found.io -u admin:$(cat ~/pass-file) <2> 

./import_dashboards.sh -url https://user:password@xyz.found.io <3>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
<1> Specify the username and password separated by a colon.
<2> Use a file to avoid polluting the bash history with the password.
<3> Put the username and password in the URL.

These options are also available when you run `.\import_dashboards.ps1` on Windows.

=== Opening the Beats Dashboards in Kibana

After <<load-kibana-dashboards,loading the Beats dashboards>>,
launch the Kibana web interface by pointing your browser
to port 5601. For example, http://127.0.0.1:5601[http://127.0.0.1:5601].

If Kibana shows a `No default index pattern` warning, you must select or create
an index pattern to continue. To resolve the issue, select one of the
predefined index patterns and set it as the default.

[NOTE]
.Known Issue in 5.0.0-alpha4
====
There is a known issue in the 5.0.0-alpha4 release of Kibana that affects
the loading process of our sample dashboards. It only affects brand new
installations of Kibana 5.0.0-alpha4 that donâ€™t yet have any indices defined. 
To resolve this error, see the "Known issue and workaround" section
https://www.elastic.co/blog/beats-5-0-0-alpha4-released[here].

This issue is resolved in 5.0.0-alpha5.
