=== Loading the Beats Dashboards

Kibana has a large set of visualization types that you can combine to create
the perfect dashboards for your needs. But this flexibility can be a bit
overwhelming at the beginning, so we have created a couple of
https://github.com/elastic/beats-dashboards[Sample Dashboards] to get you
started and to demonstrate what is possible based on the Beats data.

NOTE: The Beats dashboards require Kibana 4.

To load the sample dashboards, you run a load script. The load script
uploads the example dashboards, visualizations, and searches
that you can use. The load command also creates index patterns for each Beat:

   - [packetbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD
   - [topbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD
   - [filebeat-]YYYY.MM.DD
   
Use the following commands to run the script:

*deb, rpm, and mac:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O http://download.elastic.co/beats/dashboards/beats-dashboards-{Dashboards-version}.zip
unzip beats-dashboards-{Dashboards-version}.zip
cd beats-dashboards-{Dashboards-version}/
./load.sh
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the script assumes that you are running Elasticsearch on `127.0.0.1:9200`. Use the `-url` option
to specify a different location. For example: `./load.sh -url http://192.168.33.60:9200`. To specify a Kibana index pattern or pass in user credentials, see <<dashboard-load-options>>.

*win:*

. Download the Beats dashboards from 
http://download.elastic.co/beats/dashboards/beats-dashboards-{Dashboards-version}.zip. 

. Extract the contents of the archive.

. Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon
and select *Run As Administrator*). If you are running Windows XP, you may need
to download and install PowerShell. 

. Run the following commands to load the dashboards:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > cd beats-dashboards-{Dashboards-version}
PS > .\load.ps1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
By default, the script assumes that you are running Elasticsearch on `127.0.0.1:9200`. Use the `-url` option
to specify a different location. For example: `.\load.ps1 -url http://192.168.33.60:9200`. To specify a Kibana index pattern or pass in user credentials, see <<dashboard-load-options>>.
+
NOTE: If script execution is disabled on your system, you need to set the execution policy for the current session to allow the script to run. For example: `PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File .\load.ps1 -url http://192.168.33.60:9200`.

=== Other Dashboard Load Options
When you load the Beats dashboards, you can also specify:

* The Kibana index pattern where you want to load the dashboards in Elasticsearch. For example:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./load.sh -url http://test.com:9200 -index .kibana_env
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* The username and password to use for authentication. There are a few ways to pass in the username and password. For example:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./load.sh -url https://xyz.found.io -u user:password <1>

./load.sh -url https://xyz.found.io -u admin:$(cat ~/pass-file) <2> 

./load.sh -url https://user:password@xyz.found.io <3>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
<1> Specify the username and password separated by a colon.
<2> Use a file to avoid polluting the bash history with the password.
<3> Put the username and password in the URL.

These options are also available when you run `.\load.ps1` on Windows.

=== Opening the Beats Dashboards in Kibana

After <<load-kibana-dashboards,loading the Beats dashboards>>,
launch the Kibana web interface by pointing your browser
to port 5601. For example, `http://127.0.0.1:5601`.

If Kibana raises a `No default index pattern` error, you must select or create
an index pattern to continue. You can resolve the error by refreshing the page
in the browser and then setting one of the predefined index patterns as the default.

To open the loaded dashboards, go to the `Dashboard` page and click the
*Load Saved Dashboard* icon. Select `Packetbeat Dashboard` from the list.
You can then easily switch between the dashboards by using the `Navigation` widget.

Of course, you won't see actual data until you've installed and
configured your Beat.
