{beatname_uc} comes packaged with example Kibana dashboards, visualizations,
and searches for visualizing {beatname_uc} data in Kibana. Before you can use
the dashboards, you need to create the index  pattern, +{beatname_lc}-*+, and
load the dashboards into Kibana. To do this, you can either run the `setup`
command (as described here) or
<<configuration-dashboards,configure dashboard loading>> in the
+{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file.

NOTE: Starting with Beats 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration. You should have configured the
endpoint earlier when you
<<{beatname_lc}-configuration,configured {beatname_uc}>>. If you didn't,
configure it now.

Make sure Kibana is running before you perform this step. If you are accessing a
secured Kibana instance, make sure you've configured credentials as described in
<<{beatname_lc}-configuration>>.

To set up the Kibana dashboards for {beatname_uc}:

ifdef::allplatforms[]

*deb, rpm, and mac:*

From the directory where you installed {beatname_uc}, run:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./{beatname_lc} setup --dashboards
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ifeval::["{requires-sudo}"=="yes"]

If you changed ownership of the config file to root, you'll need preface this
command with `sudo`.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{beatname_lc}"!="auditbeat"]

*docker:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
docker run {dockerimage} setup --dashboards
----------------------------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

*win:*

endif::allplatforms[]

Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon
and select *Run As Administrator*). If you are running Windows XP, you may need
to download and install PowerShell.

From the PowerShell prompt, change to the directory where you installed {beatname_uc},
and run:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > {beatname_lc} setup --dashboards
----------------------------------------------------------------------
