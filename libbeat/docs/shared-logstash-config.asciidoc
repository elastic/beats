*Prerequisite:* To use Logstash as an output, you must also
{libbeat}/logstash-installation.html#logstash-setup[set up Logstash] to receive events
from Beats. 

If you want to use Logstash to perform additional processing on the data collected by
{beatname_uc}, you need to configure {beatname_uc} to use Logstash.

To do this, you edit the {beatname_uc} configuration file to disable the Elasticsearch
output by commenting it out and enable the Logstash output by uncommenting the 
logstash section:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["127.0.0.1:5044"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `hosts` option specifies the Logstash server and the port (`5044`) where Logstash is configured to listen for incoming
Beats connections.

For this configuration, you must <<load-template-manually,load the index template into Elasticsearch manually>>
because the options for auto loading the template are only available for the Elasticsearch output.

TIP: To test your configuration file, change to the directory where the {beatname_uc} 
binary is installed, and run {beatname_uc} in the foreground with the following
options specified: +./{beatname_lc} -configtest -e+. Make sure your config files are
in the path expected by {beatname_uc} (see <<directory-layout>>). If you
installed from DEB or RPM packages, run +./{beatname_lc}.sh -configtest -e+.
