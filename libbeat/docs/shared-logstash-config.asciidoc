If you want to use Logstash to perform additional processing on the data collected by
{beatname_uc}, you need to configure {beatname_uc} to use Logstash.

To do this, you edit the {beatname_uc} configuration file to disable the Elasticsearch
output by commenting it out and enable the Logstash output by uncommenting the 
logstash section:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["127.0.0.1:5044"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this configuration, `hosts` specifies the Logstash server and the port (`5044`)
where Logstash is configured to listen for incoming Beats connections.

TIP: To test your configuration file, run {beatname_uc} in the foreground with the following options specified:
+./{beatname_lc} -configtest -e+.

To use this configuration, you must also
{libbeat}/logstash-installation.html#logstash-setup[set up Logstash] to receive events
from Beats.
