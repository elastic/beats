You can defined processors in any Beat as it is part of libbeat. Processors are used to reduce the number of
the exported fields, but also to enhance them with additional meta data.
Each processor receives an event, applies a defined action to the event and returns it. In case you define a list of
processors, then they are executed in the order they are defined in the configuration file.

The processors are defined in the {beatname_uc} configuration file.
