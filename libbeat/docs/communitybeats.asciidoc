== Community Beats

The open source community has been hard at work developing new Beats. You can check
out some of them here.

Have a question about a community Beat? You can post questions and discuss issues in the
https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats/community-beats[Community Beats] category of the Beats discussion forum.

Have you created a Beat that's not listed? Add the name and description of your Beat to the source document for
https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/master/libbeat/docs/communitybeats.asciidoc[Community Beats] and https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests[open a pull request] in the https://github.com/elastic/beats[Beats GitHub repository] to get your change merged. When you're ready, go ahead and https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements[announce] your new Beat in the Elastic
discussion forum.
