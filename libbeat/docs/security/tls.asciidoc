=== Configure {beatname_uc} to use encrypted connections

If encryption is enabled on the {es} cluster, you need to connect to {es} via
HTTPS. If the certificate authority (CA) that signed your node certificates
is not in the host system's trusted certificate authorities list, you also need
to add the path to the `.pem` file that contains your CA's certificate to the
{beatname_uc} configuration.

To configure a {beatname_uc} to connect to {es} via HTTPS, add the `https`
protocol to all host URLs:

["source","js",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://localhost:9200"] <1>
  index: "{beatname_lc}"
  ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"] <2>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Specify the `https` protocol to connect the {es} cluster.
<2> Specify the path to the local `.pem` file that contains your Certificate
Authority's certificate. This is generally only needed if you use your
own CA to sign your node certificates.
