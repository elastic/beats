=== Configuring the built-in user for {beatname_uc}

{security} provides built-in user credentials in {es} that have a fixed set of
privileges. In 6.3.0 and later releases, there is a `beats_system` built-in user,
which {beatname_uc} uses to store monitoring information in {es}.

The initial passwords for all of the built-in users are set by using the
`setup-passwords` tool in {es}. Thereafter, you can change the passwords by
using the *Management > Users* page in Kibana or the
{ref}/security-api-change-password.html[Change Password API].

IMPORTANT: If you upgraded from {es} version 6.2 or earlier, you will not
have set a password for the `beats_system` user. A user with the
`manage_security` privilege must change the password for this built-in user.
