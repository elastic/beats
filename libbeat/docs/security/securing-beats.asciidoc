If you want {beatname_uc} to connect to a cluster that has
{security-features} enabled, there are extra configuration steps:

. <<feature-roles>>.
+
You can use role-based access control to grant {beatname_uc} users access to
secured resources.

. <<beats-api-keys>>.
+
You can use API keys to grant access to {es} more securely.

. <<beats-basic-auth>>.
+
To interact with a secured cluster, {beatname_uc} must either provide basic
authentication credentials or present a client certificate.

. <<beats-tls>>.
+
If encryption is enabled on the cluster, you need to enable HTTPS in the
{beatname_uc} configuration.
