== {beatname_uc} and {security}

If you want {beatname_uc} to connect to a cluster that has {security} enabled,
there are extra configuration steps.

To send data to a secured cluster through the `elasticsearch` output,
{beatname_uc} needs to authenticate as a user who can manage index templates,
monitor the cluster, create indices, and read, and write to the indices
it creates. See <<beats-basic-auth>>.

If encryption is enabled on the cluster, you also need to enable HTTPS in the
{beatname_uc} configuration. See <<beats-tls>>.

In addition to configuring authentication credentials for the {beatname_uc}
itself, you need to grant authorized users permission to access the indices it
creates. See <<beats-user-access>>.

If you plan to monitor {beatname_uc} in Kibana, you must also 
<<beats-system-user,configure the `beats_system` built-in user>>.

For more information about {security}, see
{xpack-ref}/xpack-security.html[Securing {es} and {kib}].
