== Configure {beatname_uc} to use {security}

++++
<titleabbrev>Use {security}</titleabbrev>
++++

If you want {beatname_uc} to connect to a cluster that has
{securitydoc}/xpack-security.html[{security}] enabled, there are extra
configuration steps:

. <<beats-basic-auth>>.
+
ifeval::["{beatname_lc}"=="filebeat"]
To send data to a secured cluster through the `elasticsearch` output,
{beatname_uc} needs to authenticate as a user who can manage index templates,
monitor the cluster, create indices, read and write to the indices
it creates, and manage ingest pipelines. 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{beatname_lc}"!="filebeat"]
To send data to a secured cluster through the `elasticsearch` output,
{beatname_uc} needs to authenticate as a user who can manage index templates,
monitor the cluster, create indices, and read and write to the indices
it creates. 
endif::[]

. <<beats-user-access>>.
+
To search the indexed {beatname_uc} data and visualize it in {kib}, users need
access to the indices {beatname_uc} creates.

. <<beats-tls>>.
+
If encryption is enabled on the cluster, you need to enable HTTPS in the
{beatname_uc} configuration.

. <<beats-system-user>>.
+
{beatname_uc} uses the +{beat_monitoring_user}+ user to send monitoring data to {es}. If
you plan to monitor {beatname_uc} in {kib} and have not yet set up the
password, set it up now.

{xpack-ref}/xpack-security.html[Securing the {stack}].

[[feature-roles]]
=== {beatname_uc} features that require authorization

After securing {beatname_uc}, make sure your users have the roles (or associated
privileges) required to use these {beatname_uc} features. You must create the
++{beat_default_index_prefix}_writer++ and
++{beat_default_index_prefix}_reader++ roles (see <<beats-basic-auth>> and
<<beats-user-access>>). The other roles are
{xpack-ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in].
