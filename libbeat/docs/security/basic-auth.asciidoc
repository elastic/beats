=== Configure authentication credentials

When sending data to a secured cluster through the `elasticsearch`
output, {beatname_uc} must either provide basic authentication credentials
or present a client certificate.

*Before you begin:* <<feature-roles>>.

You specify authentication credentials in the {beatname_uc} configuration
file: 

* To use basic authentication, specify the `username` and `password` settings
under `output.elasticsearch`. For example: 
+
--
["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  username: "{beat_default_index_prefix}_internal" <1>
  password: "{pwd}" <2>
----
<1> Let's assume this user has the privileges required to publish events to
{es}.
<2> The example shows a hard-coded password, but you should store sensitive
values in the <<keystore,secrets keystore>>.
--
ifndef::apm-server[]
+
If you've configured the {kib} endpoint, also specify credentials for
authenticating with {kib}. For example:
+
["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----
setup.kibana:
  host: "mykibanahost:5601"
  username: "{beat_default_index_prefix}_internal" <1>
  password: "{pwd}" 
----
<1> Let's assume this user has the privileges required to set up dashboards.
endif::apm-server[]

* To use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates to authenticate users,
configure the `certificate` and `key` settings. These settings assume that the
distinguished name (DN) in the certificate is mapped to the appropriate roles in
the `role_mapping.yml` file on each node in the {es} cluster. For more
information, see {xpack-ref}/mapping-roles.html#mapping-roles-file[Using Role
Mapping Files].

["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
  ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
