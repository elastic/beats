=== Grant users access to secured resources

You can use role-based access control to grant users access to secured
resources. The roles that you set up depend on your organization's security
requirements and the minimum privileges required to use specific features. 

{beatname_uc} users typically perform these main roles: they do the initial
setup, publish monitoring information, and publish events. If they're using
{kib}, they view and sometimes create visualizations that access {beatname_uc}
indices.

{security} provides pre-built roles that grant _some_ of the privileges needed
by {beatname_uc} users. When possible, use the built-in roles to minimize the
affect of future changes on your security strategy.

For privileges not granted by existing roles, create new roles. At a minimum,
create a role for setting up {beatname_uc}, a role for publishing events, and a
role for reading {beatname_uc} indices. Assign these new roles, along with the
pre-built roles, to grant the full set of privileges required by {beatname_uc}
users.

The following sections describe the privileges and roles required to perform
specific job roles. 

[[privileges-to-setup-beats]]
==== Privileges needed for initial setup

Users who set up {beatname_uc} typically need to load mappings, dashboards, and
other objects used to index data into {es} and visualize it in {kib}. The
privileges required depend on the setup tasks users need to perform.

NOTE: These instructions assume that you are using the default name for
{beatname_uc} indices. If you are using a custom name, modify the privileges to
match your index naming pattern.

[[privileges-to-publish-monitoring]]
==== Privileges needed to publish and view monitoring information

{security} provides the +{beat_default_index_prefix}_system+
{stack-ov}/built-in-users.html[built-in user] and
+{beat_default_index_prefix}_system+ {stack-ov}/built-in-roles.html[built-in
role] for sending monitoring information. You can use the built-in user, or
create a user who has the privileges needed to send monitoring information.
If you use the +{beat_default_index_prefix}_system+ user, make sure you
<<beats-system-user,set the password>>.

[[privileges-to-publish-events]]
==== Privileges needed to publish events

Users who publish events to {es} need to create and read from {beatname_uc}
indices. The privileges required for this role depend on the tasks users
need to perform:

// Are there other privileges that might be required as indices move through the
// lifecycle stages?

[[kibana-user-privileges]]
==== Privileges needed by {kib} users

{kib} users typically need to view dashboards and visualizations that contain
{beatname_uc} data. These users might also need to create and edit dashboards
and visualizations.
ifdef::has_central_config[]
If you're using Beats central management, they need to create and manage
configurations.

The privileges required for {kib} users depend on the tasks they need to
perform:
