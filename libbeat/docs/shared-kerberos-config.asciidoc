== Configure Kerberos

You can specify Kerberos options with any output or input that supports Kerberos, like {es}.

The following encryption types are supported:

* aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96
* aes128-cts-hmac-sha256-128
* aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96
* aes256-cts-hmac-sha384-192
* des3-cbc-sha1-kd
* rc4-hmac

Example output config with Kerberos password based authentication:

[source,yaml]
----
output.elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://my-elasticsearch.elastic.co:9200"]
output.elasticsearch.kerberos.auth_type: password
output.elasticsearch.kerberos.username: "elastic"
output.elasticsearch.kerberos.password: "changeme"
output.elasticsearch.kerberos.config_path: "/etc/krb5.conf"
output.elasticsearch.kerberos.realm: "ELASTIC.CO"
----

The service principal name for the Elasticsearch instance is contructed from these options. Based on this configuration
it is going to be `HTTP/my-elasticsearch.elastic.co@ELASTIC.CO`.

=== Configuration options

You can specify the following options in the `kerberos` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

[float]
==== `enabled`

The `enabled` setting can be used to enable the kerberos configuration by setting
it to `false`. The default value is `true`.

NOTE: Kerberos settings are disabled if either `enabled` is set to `false` or the
`kerberos` section is missing.

[float]
==== `auth_type`

There are two options to authenticate with Kerberos KDC: `password` and `keytab`.

`password` expects the principal name and its password. When choosing `keytab`, you
have to specify a principal name and a path to a keytab. The keytab must contain
the keys of the selected principal. Otherwise, authentication will fail.

[float]
==== `config_path`

You need to set the path to the `krb5.conf`, so +{beatname_lc} can find the Kerberos KDC to
retrieve a ticket.

[float]
==== `username`

Name of the principal used to connect to the output.

[float]
==== `password`

If you configured `password` for `auth_type`, you have to provide a password
for the selected principal.

[float]
==== `keytab`

If you configured `keytab` for `auth_type`, you have to provide the path to the
keytab of the selected principal.

[float]
==== `service_name`

This option can only be configured for Kafka. It is the name of the Kafka service, usually `kafka`.

[float]
==== `realm`

Name of the realm where the output resides.
