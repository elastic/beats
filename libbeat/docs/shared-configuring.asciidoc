//Added conditional coding to support Beats that don't offer all of these install options

ifeval::["{beatname_lc}"!="auditbeat"]

To configure {beatname_uc}, you edit the configuration file. For rpm and deb,
you'll find the configuration file at +/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.yml+. Under
Docker, it's located at +/usr/share/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.yml+. For mac and win,
look in the archive that you just extracted. There’s also a full example
configuration file called +{beatname_lc}.reference.yml+ that shows all non-deprecated
options.
