To configure {beatname_uc}, you edit the configuration file. The default
configuration file is called  +{beatname_lc}.yml+. The location of the file
varies by platform. To locate the file, see <<directory-layout>>. 

ifeval::["{beatname_lc}"!="apm-server"]
There’s also a full example configuration file called +{beatname_lc}.reference.yml+ 
that shows all non-deprecated options.

TIP: See the
{beats-ref}/config-file-format.html[Config File Format] section of the
_Beats Platform Reference_ for more about the structure of the config file.
