== Specify SSL settings

You can specify SSL options for any <<configuring-output,output>> that supports
SSL. You can also specify SSL options when you
<<setup-kibana-endpoint,set up the Kibana endpoint>>.

Example output config with SSL enabled:

[source,yaml]
----
output.elasticsearch.hosts: ["192.168.1.42:9200"]
output.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]
output.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
output.elasticsearch.ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
----

Also see <<configuring-ssl-logstash>>.
endif::[]

Example Kibana endpoint config with SSL enabled:

[source,yaml]
----
setup.kibana.host: "192.0.2.255:5601"
setup.kibana.protocol: "https"
setup.kibana.ssl.enabled: true
setup.kibana.ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]
setup.kibana.ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
setup.kibana.ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key

=== Configuration options

You can specify the following options in the `ssl` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

[float]
==== `enabled`

The `enabled` setting can be used to disable the ssl configuration by setting
it to `false`. The default value is `true`.

NOTE: SSL settings are disabled if either `enabled` is set to `false` or the
`ssl` section is missing.

[float]
==== `certificate_authorities`

The list of root certificates for server verifications. If `certificate_authorities` is empty or not set, the trusted certificate authorities of the host system are used.

[float]
[[certificate]]
==== `certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"`

The path to the certificate for SSL client authentication. If the certificate
is not specified, client authentication is not available. The connection
might fail if the server requests client authentication. If the SSL server does not
require client authentication, the certificate will be loaded, but not requested or used
by the server.

When this option is configured, the <<certificate_key,`certificate_key`>> option is also required.

[float]
[[certificate_key]]
==== `key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"`

The client certificate key used for client authentication. This option is required if <<certificate,`certificate`>> is specified.

[float]
==== `key_passphrase`

The passphrase used to decrypt an encrypted key stored in the configured `key` file.

[float]
==== `supported_protocols`

List of allowed SSL/TLS versions. If SSL/TLS server decides for protocol versions
not configured, the connection will be dropped during or after the handshake. The
setting is a list of allowed protocol versions:
`SSLv3`, `TLSv1` for TLS version 1.0, `TLSv1.0`, `TLSv1.1` and `TLSv1.2`.

The default value is `[TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]`.

[float]
==== `verification_mode`

This option controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host
names. Valid values are `none` and `full`. If `verification_mode` is set
to `none`, all server host names and certificates are accepted. In this mode,
TLS-based connections are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use this
option for testing only.

The default is `full`.

[float]
==== `cipher_suites`

The list of cipher suites to use. The first entry has the highest priority.
If this option is omitted, the Go crypto library's default
suites are used (recommended).

The following cipher suites are available:

* RSA-RC4-128-SHA (disabled by default - RC4 not recommended)
* RSA-3DES-CBC3-SHA
* RSA-AES-128-CBC-SHA
* RSA-AES-256-CBC-SHA
* ECDHE-ECDSA-RC4-128-SHA (disabled by default - RC4 not recommended)
* ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-128-CBC-SHA
* ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-256-CBC-SHA
* ECDHE-RSA-RC4-128-SHA (disabled by default- RC4 not recommended)
* ECDHE-RSA-3DES-CBC3-SHA
* ECDHE-RSA-AES-128-CBC-SHA
* ECDHE-RSA-AES-256-CBC-SHA
* ECDHE-RSA-AES-128-GCM-SHA256 (TLS 1.2 only)
* ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-128-GCM-SHA256 (TLS 1.2 only)
* ECDHE-RSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384 (TLS 1.2 only)
* ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384 (TLS 1.2 only)

Here is a list of acronyms used in defining the cipher suites:

* 3DES:
  Cipher suites using triple DES

* AES-128/256:
  Cipher suites using AES with 128/256-bit keys.

* CBC:
  Cipher using Cipher Block Chaining as block cipher mode.

* ECDHE:
  Cipher suites using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (DH) ephemeral key exchange.

* ECDSA:
  Cipher suites using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for authentication.

* GCM:
  Galois/Counter mode is used for symmetric key cryptography.

* RC4:
  Cipher suites using RC4.

* RSA:
  Cipher suites using RSA.

* SHA, SHA256, SHA384:
  Cipher suites using SHA-1, SHA-256 or SHA-384.

[float]
==== `curve_types`

The list of curve types for ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange).

The following elliptic curve types are available:

* P-256
* P-384
* P-521

[float]
==== `renegotiation`

This configures what types of TLS renegotiation are supported. The valid options
are `never`, `once`, and `freely`. The default value is never.

* `never` - Disables renegotiation.
* `once` - Allows a remote server to request renegotiation once per connection.
* `freely` - Allows a remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation.
