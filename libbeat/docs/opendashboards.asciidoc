To open the dashboards, launch the {kib} web interface by pointing your browser
to port 5601. For example, http://localhost:5601[http://localhost:5601].
Replace `localhost` with the name of the {kib} host.  If you're using an
https://cloud.elastic.co/[Elastic Cloud] instance, log in to your cloud account,
then navigate to the {kib} endpoint in your deployment.

On the *Discover* page, make sure that the predefined +{beatname_lc}-*+ index
pattern is selected to see {beatname_uc} data.

TIP: If you don’t see data in {kib}, try changing the date range to a larger
range. By default, {kib} shows the last 15 minutes.

Go to the *Dashboard* page and select the dashboard that you want to open.
