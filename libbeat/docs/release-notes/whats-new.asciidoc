=== {log-driver-long} now supports `docker logs` command

Starting with version 7.9, the {log-driver-long} fully supports the `docker logs`
command. The plugin maintains a local copy of logs that can be read without a
connection to {es}. The plugin mounts the `/var/lib/docker` directory on the
host to write logs to `/var/log/containers`. For more information, see the
{docker-logging-ref}/index.html[Elastic Logging Plugin for Docker] docs.
