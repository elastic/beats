==== Support for monitoring Google Cloud service metrics

In this release, we've added support for monitoring Google Cloud operations
suite (formerly Stackdriver). The new
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-metricset-googlecloud-stackdriver.html[stackdriver]
metricset in the Google Cloud Platform module collects any service metrics from
Google Cloud by using the `ListTimeSeries` API call.

For a full list of metric types that Google Cloud monitoring supports, see the
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp[Google Cloud metrics]
documentation.

==== Specialized Linux integration

To simplify Linux monitoring, weâ€™ve introduced a new
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-linux.html[Linux] module that contains metrics
exclusive to the Linux kernel and various subsystems. This is done primarily to
avoid cluttering the System module with metricsets that are not broadly
cross-compatible. The new Linux module currently includes these metricsets:
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-metricset-linux-pageinfo.html[pageinfo],
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-metricset-linux-ksm.html[ksm], and
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-metricset-linux-conntrack.html[conntrack].
