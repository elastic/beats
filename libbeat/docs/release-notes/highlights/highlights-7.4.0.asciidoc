==== New {filebeat} inputs for ingesting S3 and Kafka logs

The {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-input-s3.html[S3 input] in {filebeat} is a beta
feature available under the Basic license, meaning it’s free to use. It ingests
raw log lines from S3 buckets by leveraging SQS queues for scalable consumption.
We recommend using this {filebeat} input instead of the {ls} S3 input if you are
looking for a horizontally scalable solution for ingesting logs from S3.

The {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-input-kafka.html[kafka input] in {filebeat} enables
data consumption from Kafka topics. Multiple {filebeat} instances can subscribe
to the same Kafka consumer group for parallel processing from topics.
Additionally, the Kafka input can consume data from Azure Event Hubs given the
service supports Kafka interface compatibility.
