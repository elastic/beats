==== Scripted processing

In this release, Beats offers a {filebeat-ref}/processor-script.html[script
processor] for processing events with Javascript code. It also includes an event
API that eases the overall event manipulation experience. As Beats often run on
host servers, the script processor has been properly sandboxed to only execute
https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/[ECMAScript 5.1 code]. It can
therefore only manipulate the event that itâ€™s given and cannot interact with the
host or any external services.

==== Security analytics

{beats} adds several new integrations for security use cases. {filebeat} offers
new logging modules for popular firewall technologies. The
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-panw.html[Palo Alto Networks module] monitors
PAN-OS firewall logs, and the {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-cisco.html[Cisco
ASA module] monitors Cisco ASA firewall logs. These logs can be received via
syslog or extracted directly from a file. {filebeat} also offers a new
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-netflow.html[NetFlow module] that monitors
NetFlow and IPFIX flow records.

Beyond these integrations, the 7.2 release introduces the Elastic
{kibana-ref}/xpack-siem.html[SIEM application in {kib}].

==== Cloud monitoring

The {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-nats.html[NATS module] is now available in
{filebeat} for monitoring the NATS messaging system logs. This complements the
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-nats.html[NATS module in {metricbeat}] that
was introduced in {beats} 7.0.0. This release also adds
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-coredns.html[CoreDNS modules in {filebeat}] and
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-coredns.html[{metricbeat}] to monitor CoreDNS
logs and metrics.

{filebeat} also introduces a new
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-input-container.html[container input] as a more dynamic
way of collecting container logs. It supports auto-detection of both Docker and
CRI-O log formats. CRI-O is an increasingly popular container runtime for
Kubernetes. You should use the container input in favor of the existing Docker
input, which is now deprecated.

==== Windows monitoring

Winlogbeat adds two new modules in this release. The
{winlogbeat-ref}/winlogbeat-module-sysmon.html[Sysmon module] monitors event log
records from the Sysinternals System Monitor, and the
{winlogbeat-ref}/winlogbeat-module-security.html[Security module] monitors
Windows security event logs. This release also adds support for the newer
Windows XML Event Log (EVTX) format.
