==== New modules for Azure cloud monitoring

With the addition of {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-azure.html[{metricbeat}]
and {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-azure.html[{filebeat}] modules for Azure
monitoring, Azure users can now directly monitor logs and metrics from Azure
Event Hub and Azure Monitor and use prebuilt {kib} dashboards to speed up the
analysis.

==== {heartbeat} enhanced with hint-based autodiscover

In 7.5, weâ€™ve enhanced {heartbeat}, as part of our Uptime solution, to include
{heartbeat-ref}/[hint-based autodiscover], which is a particularly great fit
for monitoring the health of Kubernetes services.
