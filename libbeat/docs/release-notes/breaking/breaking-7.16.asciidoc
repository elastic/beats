==== {journalbeat} is deprecated in 7.16

{journalbeat}, a lightweight shipper for collecting logs written by the Journald
system service, is deprecated in 7.16. This functionality is instead provided as
a {filebeat} input. If you're currently using {journalbeat}, you should begin
using the `journald` input in {filebeat} instead. For more information, refer to
the
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-input-journald.html[Journald input] documentation.

If you're using {agent} instead of {beats}, you can collect Journald logs by
adding the *Custom Journald logs* integration to your agent policy. For more
information, refer to
{fleet-guide}/add-integration-to-policy.html[Add an {agent} integration to a policy]. 

//TODO: Add pointer to the integrations docs for custom journald logs when
//available.
