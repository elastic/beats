==== {beats} logs are now ECS-compliant

All Elastic {beats} now write ECS-compliant logs in JSON format, and the config
options for enabling ECS/JSON are removed. The new log name format is
`{beatname}-{date}(-n)?.ndjson`. For example (from oldest to newest):
`filebeat-20200101.ndjson`, `filebeat-20200101-1.ndjson`,
`filebeat-20200101-2.ndjson`, and so on.

With this change, we now provide a uniform logging scheme across Elastic
products, which makes it easier to develop ECS-aware visualizations for
behaviors like correlating metrics or events across products.

If you have any monitoring configurations that expect the old log format, you
must update them to use the new log format.

==== {beats} now store events in data streams instead of indices

All {beats} shippers now store events in data streams in {es} instead of indices
regardless of the {es} version. This change affects the underlying data storage
method used in {es}; it does not change the naming convention. The name of the
data stream follows the format `{beatname}-{version}`, and the index pattern is
`{beatname}-{version}`. Do not confuse this change with the naming convention we
use in Elastic integrations.

As part of this change, some index lifecycle managment (ILM) options
(`rollover_alias` and `pattern`) are removed because data streams do not
require index aliases. Also the `setup.template.type` option is removed because
it no longer makes sense.

If you are loading JSON index templates by specifying a file in
`setup.template.json.path`, make sure you move from the legacy format to
composable index templates.

NOTE: Data streams support create operations only. Thus, there is no
way to use operation types like "index" or "delete" when sending events to {es}.

For more information, refer to the {es} documentation about
{ref}/data-streams.html[data streams].

==== Homebrew formulae no longer available for {beats}

Starting with version 8.0.0, Elastic no longer publishes Homebrew formulae for
{beats}. You must use a different installation method. See
the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/[{beats} download pages]
for available installation methods.

==== Removal of older platforms from {beats} support matrix
Starting with version 8.0.0, the following operating systems are no longer supported
by {beats} due to lack of vendor support for the operating system. In order to have
the best product experience, you are encouraged to move to a vendor-supported 
version of the operating system.

.*These platforms are:*
* Centos 6
* Centos 8
* RHEL 6
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Debian 8
* Windows 7 SP1
* Windows Server 2008 R2
* MacOS 10.13
* MacOS 10.14

==== {filebeat} filesets are disabled by default
Prior to version 8.0.0, modules had some filesets that were enabled by default.
This meant that in some cases you could enable a module from the command line
and run it without modifying the configuration in the `modules.d` directory.
However this caused problems for some users.

Starting in version 8.0.0, filesets are disabled by default. You must explicitly
enable the filesets you want {filebeat} to use.
