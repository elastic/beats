==== Some {filebeat} Okta module settings no longer accept JSON strings

Prior to version 7.9, the OKTA module accepted JSON strings for some
configuration settings (`http_headers`, `http_request_body`, `pagination`,
`rate_limit`, and `ssl`). This was inconsistent with other {beats} settings, so
it has been removed.

The affected settings now expect regular YAML objects for values.
