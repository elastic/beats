==== Version removed from default ILM policy name

To prevent custom ILM policies from breaking during upgrades, the default 
ILM policy name no longer includes the {beats} version.

If you want to include the version, use the `setup.ilm.policy_name`
configuration setting. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
setup.ilm.policy_name: "%{[agent.name]}-%{[agent.version]}"
----

// end::notable-breaking-changes[]
