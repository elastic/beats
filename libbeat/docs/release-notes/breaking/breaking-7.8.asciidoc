==== Known issue with Kafka output

The Kafka output fails to connect when using multiple TLS brokers. We advise
not to upgrade to {beats} 7.8.0 if you're using the Kafka output in this
configuration.

====  APM Instrumentation

Libbeat includes the Elastic APM Agent for instrumenting the publishing pipeline.
Currently the Elasticsearch output is instrumented. APM can be enabled simply with
setting the `ELASTIC_APM_ACTIVE` environment variable to `true` when starting the beat.
To make tracing possible, the `Publish` method of the `Client` interface takes a
`Context` object as first argument. That `Context` is intended for propagating
request-scoped values, not for cancellation.
