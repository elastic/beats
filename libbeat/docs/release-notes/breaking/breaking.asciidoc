== Breaking changes

As a general rule, we strive to keep backwards compatibility between minor
versions (e.g.  7.x to 7.y) so you can upgrade without any configuration file
changes, but there are breaking changes between major versions (e.g. 6.x to
7.y). Migrating directly between non consecutive major versions (e.g. 5.x to
7.x) is not recommended.

See the following topics for a description of breaking changes:
