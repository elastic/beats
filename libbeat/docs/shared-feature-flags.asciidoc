The Feature Flags section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file contains
settings in {beatname_uc} that are disabled by default. These may include 
experimental features, changes to behaviors within {beatname_uc}, or 
settings that could cause a breaking change. For example a
setting that changes information included in events might be inconsistent with
the naming pattern expected in your configured {beatname_uc} output.

To enable any of the settings listed on this page, change the associated `enabled`
flag from `false` to `true`.

=== Configuration options

You can specify the following options in the `features` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file:

[float]
==== `fqdn`

Contains configuration for the FQDN reporting feature. When this feature is
enabled, the fully-qualified domain name for the host is reported in the
`host.name` field in events produced by {beatname_uc}.

For FQDN reporting to work as expected, the hostname of the current host must either:

* Have a CNAME entry defined in DNS.
* Have one of its corresponding IP addresses respond successfully to a reverse
DNS lookup.

If neither pre-requisite is satisfied, `host.name` continues to report the
hostname of the current host as if the FQDN feature flag were not enabled.

Example configuration:

  fqdn:
    enabled: true

[float]
===== `enabled`
Set to `true` to enable the FQDN reporting feature of {beatname_uc}.
Defaults to `false`.
