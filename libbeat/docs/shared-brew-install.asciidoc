//REVIEWERS: I've trimmed the instructions here so that they are parallel to
//the instructions provided for other install methods. Note that I have not been able
//to test the commands shown here (with version) specified, so please confirm
// syntax. I'm concerned that providing the command *without* the version might
// lead users to download the wrong version of the shipper, especially within
// the Beats guides where we provide exact version downloads.

To install the OSS distribution, specify +elastic/tap/{beatname_lc}-oss@{brew-version}+.
