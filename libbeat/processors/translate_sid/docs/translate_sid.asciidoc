=== Translate SID

++++
<titleabbrev>translate_sid</titleabbrev>

The `translate_sid` processor translates a Windows security identifier (SID)
into an account name. It retrieves the name of the account associated with the
SID, the first domain on which the SID is found, and the type of account. This
is only available on Windows.

Every account on a network is issued a unique SID when the account is first
created. Internal processes in Windows refer to an account's SID rather than
the account's user or group name and these values sometimes appear in logs.

If the SID is invalid (malformed) or does not map to any account on the local
system or domain then this will result in the processor returning an error
unless `ignore_failure` is set.
