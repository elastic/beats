experimental[]

The `dot_expand` processor expands fields with dots into a nested object
structure, merging objects as necessary. For example, fields `log.level`
and `log.logger` will be expanded and merged into
`log: {level: ..., logger: ...}`. Where merging would lead to a conflict
due to a mix of object and non-object keys, an error will occur and expansion
will halt.

The configuration below enables the processor with the default settings.
