// Package dns implements a processor that can perform DNS lookups by sending
// a DNS request over UDP to a recursive nameserver. Each instance of the
// processor is independent (no shared cache) so it's best to only define one
// instance of the processor.
//
// It caches DNS results in memory and honors the record's TTL. It also caches
// failures for the configured failure TTL.
//
// This filter, like all filters, only processes 1 event at a time, so the use
// of this plugin can significantly slow down your pipelineâ€™s throughput if you
// have a high latency network. By way of example, if each DNS lookup takes 2
// milliseconds, the maximum throughput you can achieve with a single filter
// worker is 500 events per second (1000 milliseconds / 2 milliseconds).
