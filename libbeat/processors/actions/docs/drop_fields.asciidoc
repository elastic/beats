=== Drop fields from events

The `drop_fields` processor specifies which fields to drop if a certain
condition is fulfilled. The condition is optional. If it's missing, the
specified fields are always dropped. The `@timestamp` and `type` fields cannot
be dropped, even if they show up in the `drop_fields` list.

-----------------------------------------------------
processors:
  - drop_fields:
      when:
        condition
      fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
      ignore_missing: false
-----------------------------------------------------

See <<conditions>> for a list of supported conditions.

NOTE: If you define an empty list of fields under `drop_fields`, then no fields
are dropped.

The `drop_fields` processor has the following configuration settings:

`fields`:: If non-empty, a list of matching field names will be removed.
Any element in array can contain a regular expression delimited by two
slashes ('/reg_exp/'), in order to match (name) and remove more than one field.

`ignore_missing`:: (Optional) If `true` the processor will not return an error
when a specified field does not exist. Defaults to `false`.
