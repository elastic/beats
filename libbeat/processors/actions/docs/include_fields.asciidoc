[[include-fields]]
=== Keep fields from events

The `include_fields` processor specifies which fields to export if a certain
condition is fulfilled. The condition is optional. If it's missing, the
specified fields are always exported. The `@timestamp` and `type` fields are
always exported, even if they are not defined in the `include_fields` list.

processors:
 - include_fields:
     when:
        condition
     fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
-------

See <<conditions>> for a list of supported conditions.

You can specify multiple `include_fields` processors under the `processors`
section.

NOTE: If you define an empty list of fields under `include_fields`, then only
the required fields, `@timestamp` and `type`, are exported.
