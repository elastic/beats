########################## Auditbeat Configuration #############################

# This is a reference configuration file documenting all non-deprecated options
# in comments. For a shorter configuration example that contains only the most
# common options, please see auditbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/index.html

# ============================== Config Reloading ==============================

# Config reloading allows to dynamically load modules. Each file which is
# monitored must contain one or multiple modules as a list.
auditbeat.config.modules:

  # Glob pattern for configuration reloading
  path: ${path.config}/modules.d/*.yml

  # Period on which files under path should be checked for changes
  reload.period: 10s

  # Set to true to enable config reloading
  reload.enabled: false

# Maximum amount of time to randomly delay the start of a dataset. Use 0 to
# disable startup delay.
auditbeat.max_start_delay: 10s

# =========================== Modules configuration ============================

    ## examples or add your own rules.

    ## If you are on a 64 bit platform, everything should be running
    ## in 64 bit mode. This rule will detect any use of the 32 bit syscalls
    ## because this might be a sign of someone exploiting a hole in the 32
    ## bit API.

    ## External access (warning: these can be expensive to audit).
    #-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S accept,bind,connect -F key=external-access

    ## Identity changes.

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested

# Internal queue configuration for buffering events to be published.

  # The spool queue will store events in a local spool file, before
  # forwarding the events to the outputs.
  #
  # Beta: spooling to disk is currently a beta feature. Use with care.
  #
  # The spool file is a circular buffer, which blocks once the file/buffer is full.
  # Events are put into a write buffer and flushed once the write buffer
  # is full or the flush_timeout is triggered.
  # Once ACKed by the output, events are removed immediately from the queue,
  # making space for new events to be persisted.
  #spool:
    # The file namespace configures the file path and the file creation settings.
    # Once the file exists, the `size`, `page_size` and `prealloc` settings
    # will have no more effect.

# ================================= Processors =================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#  - include_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu"]
#  - drop_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#  - drop_event:
#      when:
#        equals:
#          http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#  - rename:
#      fields:
#        - from: "a"
#          to: "b"
#
# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#
#processors:
#  - dissect:
#      tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#      field: "message"
#      target_prefix: "dissect"
#
# The following example enriches each event with metadata from the cloud
# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#  - add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#  - add_locale:
#      format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:
#
#processors:
#  - add_docker_metadata:
#      host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
#      match_fields: ["system.process.cgroup.id"]
#      match_pids: ["process.pid", "process.ppid"]
#      match_source: true
#      match_source_index: 4
#      match_short_id: false
#      cleanup_timeout: 60
#      labels.dedot: false
#      # To connect to Docker over TLS you must specify a client and CA certificate.
#      #ssl:
#      #  certificate_authority: "/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"
#      #  certificate:           "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
#      #  key:                   "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#  - add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:
#  - add_host_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#
#processors:
#  - add_process_metadata:
#      match_pids: ["system.process.ppid"]
#      target: system.process.parent
#
# The following example decodes fields containing JSON strings
# and replaces the strings with valid JSON objects.
#
#processors:
#  - decode_json_fields:
#      fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
#      process_array: false
#      max_depth: 1
#      target: ""
#      overwrite_keys: false
#
#processors:
#  - decompress_gzip_field:
#      from: "field1"
#      to: "field2"
#      ignore_missing: false
#      fail_on_error: true
#
# The following example copies the value of message to message_copied
#
#processors:
#  - copy_fields:
#      fields:
#        - from: message
#          to: message_copied
#      fail_on_error: true
#      ignore_missing: false
#
# The following example truncates the value of message to 1024 bytes
#
#processors:
#  - truncate_fields:
#      fields:
#        - message
#      max_bytes: 1024
#      fail_on_error: false
#      ignore_missing: true
#
# The following example preserves the raw message under event.original
#
#processors:
#  - copy_fields:
#      fields:
#        - from: message
#          to: event.original
#      fail_on_error: false
#      ignore_missing: true
#  - truncate_fields:
#      fields:
#        - event.original
#      max_bytes: 1024
#      fail_on_error: false
#      ignore_missing: true
#
# The following example URL-decodes the value of field1 to field2
#
#processors:
#  - urldecode:
#      fields:
#        - from: "field1"
#          to: "field2"
