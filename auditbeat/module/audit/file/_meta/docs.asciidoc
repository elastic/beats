=== Audit file metricset

The `file` metricset sends events when a file is changed (created, updated, or
deleted) on disk. The events contain file metadata and hashes.

The metricset is implemented for Linux, macOS (Darwin), and Windows.

=== How it works

This metricset uses features of the operating system to monitor file changes in
realtime. When the metricset starts it creates a subscription with the OS to
receive notifications of changes to the specified files or directories. Upon
receiving notification of a change the metricset will read the file's metadata
and the compute a hash of the file's contents.

This metricset does not perform an initial scan of the given paths to generate
events for the files as they existed at start time. It is strictly driven by
change notifications from the OS.

The operating system features that power this feature are as follows.

* Linux - `inotify` is used, and therefore the kernel must have inotify support.
Inotify was initially merged into the 2.6.13 Linux kernel.
* macOS (Darwin) - `kqueue` is used. It requires one file descriptor for each
file so please check the `ulimit` values used with {beatname_uc}. The FSEvents
API was considered for the implementation, but FSEvents coalesces multiple
notifications into a single event which is inconsistent with the metricset's
behavior on other operating systems.
* Windows - `ReadDirectoryChangesW` is used.

The file metricset should not be used to monitor paths on network file systems.

=== Configuration options

This metricset has some configuration options for tuning its behavior. The
following example shows all configuration options with their default values for
Linux.

[source,yaml]
----
- module: audit
  metricsets: [file]
  file.paths:
  - /bin
  - /usr/bin
  - /sbin
  - /usr/sbin
  - /etc
  file.max_file_size: 100 MiB
  file.hash_types: [sha1]
----

*`file.paths`*:: A list of paths (directories or files) to watch. The watches
are non-recursive and globs are not supported. The specified paths should exist
when the metricset is started.

*`file.max_file_size`*:: The maximum size of a file in bytes for which
{beatname_uc} will compute hashes. Files larger than this size will not be
hashed. The default value is 100 MiB. For convenience units can be specified as
a suffix to the value. The supported units are `b`, `kib`, `kb`, `mib`, `mb`,
`gib`, `gb`, `tib`, `tb`, `pib`, `pb`, `eib`, and `eb`.

*`file.hash_types`*:: A list of hash types to compute when the file changes.
The supported hash types are md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512,
sha512_224, and sha512_256. The default value is sha1.
