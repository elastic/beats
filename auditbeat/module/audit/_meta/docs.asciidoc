== Audit Module

The `audit` module reports security-relevant information based on data captured
from the operating system (OS) or services running on the OS. Although this
feature doesnâ€™t provide additional security to your system, it does make it
easier for you to discover and track security policy violations.

=== Index Management

The data produced by this metricset may contain sensitive information and may
have different access and retention requirements than other data produced by
{beatname_uc}. For these reasons you may wish to store the data in a separate
index. Below is an example configuration demonstrating how to store the data
from the `audit` module in its own index.

[source,yaml]
----
auditbeat.modules:
- module: audit
  metricsets: ["kernel"]

output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  indices:
  - index: "auditbeat-%{[beat.version]}-audit-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
    when.equals.metricset.module: "audit"
----

The default index template applied by {beatname_uc} will also apply to this
index because the pattern in the template matches the
`auditbeat-%{[beat.version]}` prefix.
