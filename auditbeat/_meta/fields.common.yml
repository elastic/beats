    Contains common fields available in all event types.
  fields:
  - name: event.module
    description: >
      The name of the module that generated the event.

  - name: event.dataset
    description: >
      The name of the module's dataset that generated the event.

  - name: event.action
    type: keyword
    example: logged-in
    description: >
      Action describes the change that triggered the event.

      For the file integrity module the possible values are:
      attributes_modified, created, deleted, updated, moved, and config_change.

  - name: event.id
    type: keyword
    description: >
      Unique ID to describe the event.

  - name: event.kind
    type: keyword
    description: >
      The kind of the event.

      This gives information about what type of information the event
      contains, without being specific to the contents of the event.  Examples
      are `event`, `state`, `alarm`. Warning: In future versions of ECS, we
      plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please use
      with caution.
    example: state

  - name: message
    type: text
    example: "Hello World"
    description: >
      For log events the message field contains the log message.

      In other use cases the message field can be used to concatenate
      different values which are then freely searchable. If multiple
      messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

  - name: process
    title: Process
    group: 2
    description: >
      These fields contain information about a process.
      These fields can help you correlate metrics information with a process id/name
      from a log message.  The `process.pid` often stays in the metric itself and is
      copied to the global field for correlation.
    type: group
    fields:
      - name: start
