== Audit Module

The `audit` module reports security-relevant information based on data captured
from the operating system (OS) or services running on the OS. Although this
feature doesnâ€™t provide additional security to your system, it does make it
easier for you to discover and track security policy violations.

=== Index Management

The data produced by this metricset may contain sensitive information and may
have different access and retention requirements than other data produced by
{beatname_uc}. For these reasons you may wish to store the data in a separate
index. Below is an example configuration demonstrating how to store the data
from the `audit` module in its own index.

[source,yaml]
----
auditbeat.modules:
- module: audit
  metricsets: ["kernel"]

output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  indices:
  - index: "auditbeat-%{[beat.version]}-audit-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
    when.equals.metricset.module: "audit"
----

The default index template applied by {beatname_uc} will also apply to this
index because the pattern in the template matches the
`auditbeat-%{[beat.version]}` prefix.


[float]
=== Example configuration

The Audit module supports the common configuration options that are
described under <<configuration-{beatname_lc},configuring {beatname_uc}>>. Here
is an example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
auditbeat.modules:
- module: audit
  metricsets: [kernel]
  kernel.audit_rules: |
    # Define audit rules here.
    # Create file watches (-w) or syscall audits (-a or -A). For example:
    #-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity
    #-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open,creat,truncate,ftruncate,openat,open_by_handle_at -F exit=-EPERM -k access

- module: audit
  metricsets: [file]
  file.paths:
    binaries:
    - /bin
    - /usr/bin
    - /sbin
    - /usr/sbin
    conf:
    - /etc
