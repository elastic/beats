Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've completed the
<<{beatname_lc}-configuration,configuration steps>> in the Getting Started.
This section describes some common use cases for changing configuration options.

To configure {beatname_uc}, you edit the configuration file. For rpm and deb,
youâ€™ll find the configuration file at +/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.yml+.
There's also a full example configuration file at
+/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.reference.yml+ that shows all non-deprecated
options. For mac and win, look in the archive that you extracted.

The {beatname_uc} configuration file uses http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax.
See the {libbeat}/config-file-format.html[Config File Format] section of the
_Beats Platform Reference_ for more about the structure of the config file.

The following topics describe how to configure {beatname_uc}:

* <<configuration-{beatname_lc}>>
* <<configuration-general-options>>
* <<{beatname_lc}-configuration-reloading>>
* <<configuring-internal-queue>>
* <<configuring-output>>
* <<ilm>>
* <<configuration-ssl>>
* <<filtering-and-enhancing-data>>
* <<configuring-ingest-node>>
* <<configuration-path>>
* <<setup-kibana-endpoint>>
* <<configuration-dashboards>>
* <<configuration-template>>
* <<configuration-logging>>
* <<using-environ-vars>>
* <<yaml-tips>>
* <<regexp-support>>
* <<http-endpoint>>
* <<{beatname_lc}-reference-yml>>

After changing configuration settings, you need to restart {beatname_uc} to
pick up the changes.
