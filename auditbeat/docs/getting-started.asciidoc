[id="{beatname_lc}-getting-started"]
== Getting started with {beatname_uc}

To get started with your own {beatname_uc} setup, install and configure these
related products:

 * Elasticsearch for storage and indexing the data.
 * Kibana for the UI.
 * Logstash (optional) for inserting data into Elasticsearch.

See {libbeat}/getting-started.html[Getting Started with Beats and the Elastic Stack]
for more information.

After installing the Elastic Stack, read the following topics to learn how to
install, configure, and run {beatname_uc}:

* <<{beatname_lc}-installation>>
* <<{beatname_lc}-configuration>>
* <<{beatname_lc}-template>>

[id="{beatname_lc}-installation"]
=== Step 1: Install {beatname_uc}

You should install {beatname_uc} on all the servers you want to monitor.

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

["source", "shell", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
docker pull {dockerimage}
------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

[[win]]
*win:*

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

. Download the {beatname_uc} Windows zip file from the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/{beatname_lc}[downloads page].

. Extract the contents of the zip file into `C:\Program Files`.

. Rename the +{beatname_lc}-<version>-windows+ directory to +{beatname_uc}+.

. Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon
and select *Run As Administrator*). If you are running Windows XP, you may need
to download and install PowerShell.

. From the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to install {beatname_uc}
as a Windows service:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > cd 'C:{backslash}Program Files{backslash}{beatname_uc}'
PS C:{backslash}Program Files{backslash}{beatname_uc}> .{backslash}install-service-{beatname_lc}.ps1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If script execution is disabled on your system, you need to set the
execution policy for the current session to allow the script to run. For
example: +PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File
.\install-service-{beatname_lc}.ps1+.

endif::[]

Before starting {beatname_uc}, you should look at the configuration options in the
configuration file, for example +C:{backslash}Program Files{backslash}{beatname_uc}{backslash}{beatname_lc}.yml+.
For more information about these options, see
<<configuring-howto-{beatname_lc}>>.

[id="{beatname_lc}-configuration"]
=== Step 2: Configure {beatname_uc}

include::../../libbeat/docs/shared-configuring.asciidoc[]

To configure {beatname_uc}:

. Define the {beatname_uc} modules that you want to enable. {beatname_uc} uses
modules to collect the audit information. For each module, specify the
metricsets that you want to collect.
+
The following example shows the `file_integrity` module configured to generate
events whenever a file in one of the specified paths changes on disk:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
-------------------------------------
auditbeat.modules:

- module: file_integrity
  paths:
  - /bin
  - /usr/bin
  - /sbin
  - /usr/sbin
  - /etc
-------------------------------------
+
If you accept the default configuration without specifying additional modules,
{beatname_uc} uses a configuration that's tailored to the operating system where
{beatname_uc} is running.
+
See <<configuring-howto-{beatname_lc}>> for more details about configuring modules.

. If you are sending output to Elasticsearch (and not using Logstash), set the
IP address and port where {beatname_uc} can find the Elasticsearch installation:
+
[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["127.0.0.1:9200"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
If you are sending output to Logstash, make sure you
<<logstash-output,Configure the Logstash output>> instead.

[id="{beatname_lc}-template"]
=== Step 3: Load the index template in Elasticsearch

=== Step 4: Set up the Kibana dashboards

[id="{beatname_lc}-starting"]
=== Step 5: Start {beatname_uc}

Run {beatname_uc} by issuing the appropriate command for your platform. If you
are accessing a secured Elasticsearch cluster, make sure you've configured
credentials as described in <<{beatname_lc}-configuration>>.

NOTE: If you use an init.d script to start {beatname_uc} on deb or rpm, you can't
specify command line flags (see <<command-line-options>>). To specify flags,
start {beatname_uc} in the foreground.

*deb:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo service {beatname_lc} start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*rpm:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo service {beatname_lc} start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*mac:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo chown root {beatname_lc}.yml <1>
sudo ./{beatname_lc} -e -c {beatname_lc}.yml -d "publish"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> To monitor system files, you'll be running {beatname_uc} as root, so you
need to change ownership of the configuration file, or run {beatname_uc} with
`-strict.perms=false` specified. See
{libbeat}/config-file-permissions.html[Config File Ownership and Permissions]
in the _Beats Platform Reference_.

If you see a warning about too many open files, you need to increase the
`ulimit`. See the <<ulimit,FAQ>> for more details.

*win:*

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS C:{backslash}Program Files{backslash}{beatname_uc}> Start-Service {beatname_lc}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By default the log files are stored in +C:{backslash}ProgramData{backslash}{beatname_lc}{backslash}Logs+.

==== Test the {beatname_uc} installation

To verify that your server's statistics are present in Elasticsearch, issue
the following command:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/{beatname_lc}-*/_search?pretty'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that you replace `localhost:9200` with the address of your
Elasticsearch instance.

On Windows, if you don't have cURL installed, simply point your browser to the
URL.

[[view-kibana-dashboards]]
=== Step 6: View the sample Kibana dashboards

To make it easier for you to start auditing the activities of users and
processes on your system, we have created example {beatname_uc} dashboards.
You loaded the dashboards earlier when you ran the `setup` command.

include::../../libbeat/docs/opendashboards.asciidoc[]

The dashboards are provided as examples. We recommend that you
{kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[customize] them to meet your needs.
