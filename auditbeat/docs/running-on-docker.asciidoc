==== Special requirements

Under Docker, {beatname_uc} runs as a non-root user, but requires some privileged
capabilities to operate correctly. Ensure that the +AUDIT_CONTROL+ and +AUDIT_READ+
capabilities are available to the container.

It is also essential to run {beatname_uc} in the host PID namespace.
