{beatname_uc} is a lightweight shipper that you can install on your servers to
periodically collect security-relevant information from the operating system
and services running on the server. For example, you can use {beatname_uc} to
collect and centralize audit events from the Linux Audit Framework. You can also
use {beatname_uc} to detect and monitor changes to critical files, like binaries
and configuration files, and identify potential security policy violations.

//TODO: Need to flesh out this description.
