=== {beatname_uc} fails to watch folders because too many files are open

Because of the way file monitoring is implemented on macOS, you may see a
warning similar to the following:

[source,shell]
----
eventreader_fsnotify.go:42: WARN [audit.file] Failed to watch /usr/bin: too many
open files (check the max number of open files allowed with 'ulimit -a')
----

To resolve this issue, run {beatname_uc} with the `ulimit` set to a larger
value, for example:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
sudo sh -c 'ulimit -n 8192 && ./{beatname_uc} -e
----

Or:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
sudo su
ulimit -n 8192
./{beatname_lc} -e
----
