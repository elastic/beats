.SYNOPSIS
    Installs {{.BeatName | title}} Windows service.
.DESCRIPTION
    Installs {{.BeatName | title}} Windows service, the data and logs path are
    set as part of the command for the service.

    For {{.BeatName | title}} < 9.1.0 the data path used to be
    'C:\ProgramData\{{.BeatName | title}}' (set from '$env:ProgramData) for >= 9.1.0
    the new default is 'C:\Program Files\{{.BeatName | title}}-Data'
    (set from '$env:ProgramFiles').

    If the legacy data path exists, then the script will move it to the new place,
    regardless of {{.BeatName | title}} version.

    You can pass ForceLegacyPath to use the legacy data path.

    If the Windows service already exists, it will be stopped and deleted, then
    the new one will be installed.
