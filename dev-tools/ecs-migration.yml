# The ECS migration file contains the information about all the Beats fields which are migrated to ECS in 7.0.
# The goal of the file is to potentially have scripts on top of this information to convert visualisations and templates
# based on this information in an automated way and to keep track of all changes which were applied.
#
# The format of the file is as following:
#
# - from: source-field-in-6.x
#   to: target-filed-in-ECS
#   # Alias field is useful for fields where many-1 mapping from new to old are needed
#   alias: true-if-alias-is-required-in-7
#   # Alias6 field is useful for fields where there is a 1-1 mapping from old to new. If absent, defaults to false.
#   alias6: true-if-alias-is-required-in-6
#   # Copy to is useful for fields where multiple fields map to the same ECS field
#   copy_to: true-if-field-should-be-copied-to-target-in-6x
