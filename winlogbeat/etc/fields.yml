  title: "Common Winlogbeat"
  description: >
    Contains common fields available in all event types.
  fields:
    - name: type
      required: true
      description: >
        The event log API type used to read the record. The possible values are
        "wineventlog" for the Windows Event Log API or "eventlogging" for the
        Event Logging API.

        The Event Logging API was designed for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP,
        or Windows 2000 operating systems. In Windows Vista, the event logging
        infrastructure was redesigned. On Windows Vista or later operating
        systems, the Windows Event Log API is used. Winlogbeat automatically
        detects which API to use for reading event logs.


- key: eventlog
  title: Event Log Record

  fields:
    - name: activity_id
      type: keyword
      required: false
      description: >
        A globally unique identifier that identifies the current activity. The
        events that are published with this identifier are part of the same
        activity.

    - name: computer_name
      type: keyword
      required: true
      description: >
        The name of the computer that generated the record. When using Windows
        event forwarding, this name can differ from the `beat.hostname`.

    - name: event_data
      type: dict
      dict-type: keyword
      required: false
      description: >
        The event specific data. This field is mutually exclusive with
        `user_data`.

    - name: event_id
      type: long
      required: true
      description: >
        The event identifier. The value is specific to the source of the event.

    - name: keywords
      type: keyword
      required: false
      description: >
        The keywords are used to classify an event.

    - name: log_name
      type: keyword
      required: true
      description: >
        The name of the event log from which this record was read. This value is
        one of the names from the `event_logs` collection in the configuration.

    - name: level
      type: keyword
      required: false
      description: >
        The level of the event. There are five levels of events that can be
        logged: Success, Information, Warning, Error, Audit Success, and Audit
        Failure.

    - name: message
      type: text
      required: false
      description: >
        The message from the event log record.

    - name: message_error
      type: keyword
      required: false
      description: >
        The error that occurred while reading and formatting the message from
        the log.

    - name: record_number
      type: keyword
      required: true
      description: >
        The record number of the event log record. The first record written
        to an event log is record number 1, and other records are numbered
        sequentially. If the record number reaches the maximum value (2^32^
        for the Event Logging API and 2^64^ for the Windows Event Log API),
        the next record number will be 0.

    - name: related_activity_id
      type: keyword
      required: false
      description: >
        A globally unique identifier that identifies the activity to which
        control was transferred to. The related events would then have this
        identifier as their `activity_id` identifier.

    - name: opcode
      type: keyword
      required: false
      description: >
        The opcode defined in the event. Task and opcode are typically used to
        identify the location in the application from where the event was
        logged.

    - name: provider_guid
      type: keyword
      required: false

        the event.

      description: >
        The source of the event log record (the application or service that
        logged the record).

    - name: task
      type: keyword
      required: false
      description: >
        The task defined in the event. Task and opcode are typically used to
        identify the location in the application from where the event was
        logged. The category used by the Event Logging API (on pre Windows Vista
        operating systems) is written to this field.

    - name: thread_id
      type: long
      required: false
      description: >

      dict-type: keyword

      description: >
        The Windows security identifier (SID) of the account associated with
        this event.


        If Winlogbeat cannot resolve the SID to a name, then the `user.name`,
        `user.domain`, and `user.type` fields will be omitted from the event.
        If you discover Winlogbeat not resolving SIDs, review the log for
        clues as to what the problem may be.

    - name: user.name
      type: keyword
      required: false
      description: >

    - name: user.domain

      required: false
      description: >
        The domain that the account associated with this event is a member of.

    - name: user.type
      type: keyword
      required: false

        The type of account associated with this event.

        The raw XML representation of the event obtained from Windows. This
        field is only available on operating systems supporting the Windows
        Event Log API (Microsoft Windows Vista and newer). This field is not
        included by default and must be enabled by setting `include_xml: true`
        as a configuration option for an individual event log.


        The XML representation of the event is useful for troubleshooting
        purposes. The data in the fields reported by Winlogbeat can be compared
        to the data in the XML to diagnose problems.
