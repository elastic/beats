        The raw XML representation of the event obtained from Windows. This
        field is only available on operating systems supporting the Windows
        Event Log API (Microsoft Windows Vista and newer). This field is not
        included by default and must be enabled by setting `include_xml: true`
        as a configuration option for an individual event log.

        The XML representation of the event is useful for troubleshooting
        purposes. The data in the fields reported by Winlogbeat can be compared
        to the data in the XML to diagnose problems.

        - name: api
          required: true
          description: >
            The event log API type used to read the record. The possible values are
            "wineventlog" for the Windows Event Log API or "eventlogging" for the
            Event Logging API.

            The Event Logging API was designed for Windows Server 2003
            or Windows 2000 operating systems. In Windows Vista, the event logging
            infrastructure was redesigned. On Windows Vista or later operating
            systems, the Windows Event Log API is used. Winlogbeat automatically
            detects which API to use for reading event logs.

        - name: activity_id
          type: keyword

        - name: computer_name
          type: keyword
          required: true
          description: >
            The name of the computer that generated the record. When using Windows

            to Windows Vista, the parameters in `event_data` are named `param1`,
            `param2`, and so on, because event log parameters are unnamed in
            earlier versions of Windows.
