    Fields from the Windows Event Log.
  fields:

    - name: event.original

      description: >
        The raw XML representation of the event obtained from Windows. This
        field is only available on operating systems supporting the Windows
        Event Log API (Microsoft Windows Vista and newer). This field is not
        included by default and must be enabled by setting `include_xml: true`
        as a configuration option for an individual event log.

        The XML representation of the event is useful for troubleshooting
        purposes. The data in the fields reported by Winlogbeat can be compared
        to the data in the XML to diagnose problems.

        All fields specific to the Windows Event Log are defined here.
      fields:

        - name: api
          required: true
          description: >
            The event log API type used to read the record. The possible values are
            "wineventlog" for the Windows Event Log API or "wineventlog-experimental" for its
            experimental implementation.

        - name: activity_id
          type: keyword
          required: false
          description: >
            A globally unique identifier that identifies the current activity. The
            events that are published with this identifier are part of the same
            activity.

        - name: computer_name
          type: keyword
          required: true
          description: >
            The name of the computer that generated the record. When using Windows
            event forwarding, this name can differ from `agent.hostname`.

          description: >
            The event-specific data. This field is mutually exclusive with
            `user_data`. If you are capturing event data on versions prior
            to Windows Vista, the parameters in `event_data` are named `param1`,
            `param2`, and so on, because event log parameters are unnamed in
            earlier versions of Windows.

            `user.domain`, and `user.type` fields will be omitted from the event.
