Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've completed the
<<winlogbeat-configuration,configuration steps>> in the Getting Started.
This section describes some common use cases for changing configuration options.

To configure {beatname_uc}, you edit the configuration file. You’ll find the configuration file,
+{beatname_lc}.yml+, in the archive that you extracted. There's also a full example configuration file at
+/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.reference.yml+ that shows all non-deprecated options.

The {beatname_uc} configuration file uses http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax. See the
{beats-ref}/config-file-format.html[Config File Format] section of the
_Beats Platform Reference_ for more about the structure of the config file.

The following topics describe how to configure Winlogbeat:

* <<configuration-winlogbeat-options>>

* <<configuring-internal-queue>>
* <<configuring-output>>
* <<ilm>>
