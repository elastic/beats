After following the <<winlogbeat-configuration,configuration steps>> in the
Getting Started, you might want to fine tune the behavior of Winlogbeat. This
section describes some common use cases for changing configuration options. 

To configure {beatname_uc}, you edit the configuration file. Youâ€™ll find the configuration file, 
+{beatname_lc}.yml+, in the archive that you extracted. There's also a full example configuration file at
+/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.full.yml+ that shows all non-deprecated options.

The following topics describe how to configure Winlogbeat:
