NOTE: Winlogbeat modules have changed in 8.0.0 to use Elasticsearch Ingest Node
for processing. If you are upgrading from 7.x please review the documentation
and see the default configuration file.

This section contains detailed information about the available Windows event
log processing modules contained in {beatname_uc}. More details about each
module can be found in the module's documentation.

{beatname_uc} modules are implemented using Elasticsearch Ingest Node pipelines.
The events receive their transformations within Elasticsearch. All events are
sent through {beatname_uc}'s "routing" pipeline that routes events to specific
module pipelines based on their `winlog.channel` value.

{beatname_uc}'s default config file contains the option to send all events to
the routing pipeline. If you remove this option then the module processing
will not be applied.

The general goal of each module is to transform events by renaming fields to
comply with the {ecs-ref}/index.html[Elastic Common Schema] (ECS). The modules
may also apply additional categorization, tagging, and parsing as necessary.

NOTE: The provided modules only support events in English. For more information
about how to configure the language in `winlogbeat`, refer to <<configuration-winlogbeat-options>>.

=== Setup of Ingest Node pipelines

{beatname_uc}'s Ingest Node pipelines must be installed to Elasticsearch if you
want to apply the module processing to events. The simplest way to get started
is to use the Elasticsearch output and Winlogbeat will automatically install
the pipelines when it first connects to Elasticsearch.

Installation Methods

=== Usage with Forwarded Events

No special configuration options are required when working with the
`ForwardedEvents` channel. The events in this log retain the channel name
of their origin (e.g. `winlog.channel: Security`). And because the routing
pipeline processes events based on the channel name no special config is
necessary.
