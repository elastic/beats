[[configuration-winlogbeat-options]]
=== Winlogbeat

The `winlogbeat` section specifies all options that are specific to Winlogbeat.
Most importantly, it contains the list of event logs to monitor.

Here is a sample configuration:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  registry_file: C:/ProgramData/winlogbeat/.winlogbeat.yml
  event_logs:
    - name: Application
      ignore_older: 72h
    - name: Security
    - name: System

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Winlogbeat Options

You can specify the following options in the `winlogbeat` section:

===== registry_file

The name of the file where Winlogbeat stores information that it uses to resume
monitoring after a restart. By default the file is stored as `.winlogbeat.yml`
in the directory where the Beat was started. When you run the process as a
Windows service, it's recommended that you set the value to
`C:/ProgramData/winlogbeat/.winlogbeat.yml`.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  registry_file: C:/ProgramData/winlogbeat/.winlogbeat.yml
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The forward slashes (/) in the path are automatically changed to backslashes
(\) for Windows compatibility. You can use either forward or backslashes. Forward
slashes are easier to work with in YAML because there is no need to escape them.

===== event_logs

A list of entries (called 'dictionaries' in YAML) that specify which event logs to
monitor. Each entry in the list defines an event log to monitor as well as any
information to be associated with the event log (filter, tags, and so on). The
`name` field is the only required field for each event log.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  event_logs:
    - name: Application
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[configuration-winlogbeat-options-event_logs-name]]
===== event_logs.name

The name of the event log to monitor. Each dictionary under `event_logs` must
have a `name` field. You can get a list of available event logs by running
`Get-EventLog *` in PowerShell.  Here is a sample of the output from the command:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PS C:\Users\vagrant> Get-EventLog *

  Max(K) Retain OverflowAction        Entries Log
  ------ ------ --------------        ------- ---
  20,480      0 OverwriteAsNeeded          75 Application
  20,480      0 OverwriteAsNeeded           0 HardwareEvents
     512      7 OverwriteOlder              0 Internet Explorer
  20,480      0 OverwriteAsNeeded           0 Key Management Service
  20,480      0 OverwriteAsNeeded       1,609 Security
  20,480      0 OverwriteAsNeeded       1,184 System
  15,360      0 OverwriteAsNeeded         464 Windows PowerShell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Channel names can also be specified if running on Windows Vista or newer.
A channel is a named stream of events that transports events from an event
source to an event log. Most channels are tied to specific event publishers.
Here is an example showing how to list all channels using PowerShell.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -ListLog * | Format-List -Property LogName
LogName : Application
LogName : HardwareEvents
LogName : Internet Explorer
LogName : Key Management Service
LogName : Security
LogName : System
LogName : Windows PowerShell
LogName : ForwardedEvents
LogName : Microsoft-Management-UI/Admin
LogName : Microsoft-Rdms-UI/Admin
LogName : Microsoft-Rdms-UI/Operational
LogName : Microsoft-Windows-Windows Firewall With Advanced Security/Firewall
...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must specify the full name of the channel in the configuration file.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  event_logs:
    - name: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Firewall With Advanced Security/Firewall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== event_logs.ignore_older

If this option is specified, Winlogbeat filters events that are
older than the specified amount of time. Valid time units are "ns",
"us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". This option is useful when you are
beginning to monitor an event log that contains older records that you would
like to ignore. This field is optional.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  event_logs:
    - name: Application
      ignore_older: 168h
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== metrics.bindaddress

The hostname and port where the Beat will host an HTTP web service that provides
metrics. This field is optional.

The following example specifies that the metrics service is available at
http://localhost:8128/debug/vars:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  metrics:
    bindaddress: 'localhost:8123'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The metrics are served as a JSON document. The metrics include:

- memory stats
- number of filtered events from each log
- number of published events from each log
- total number of failures while publishing
- total number of filtered events
- total number of successfully published events
- uptime
