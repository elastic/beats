###################### Winlogbeat Configuration Example #######################

# The registry file is where Winlogbeat persists its state so that the beat
# can resume after shutdown or an outage. The default is .winlogbeat.yml
# in the directory in which it was started.
#winlogbeat.registry_file: .winlogbeat.yml

# Diagnostic metrics that can retrieved through a web interface if a
# bindaddress value (host:port) is specified. The web address will be
# http://<bindaddress>/debug/vars
#winlogbeat.metrics:
#  bindaddress: 'localhost:8123'

# event_logs specifies a list of event logs to monitor as well as any
# accompanying options. The YAML data type of event_logs is a list of
# dictionaries.
#
# The supported keys are name (required), tags, fields, fields_under_root,
# ignore_older, level, event_id, provider, and include_xml. Please visit the
# documentation for the complete details of each option.
# https://go.es.io/WinlogbeatConfig

  - name: Application
    ignore_older: 72h
  - name: Security

#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
# combination of these.

# fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields
# sub-dictionary. Default is false.

# by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
# to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.

# The default is 10 seconds.
#refresh_topology_freq: 10
