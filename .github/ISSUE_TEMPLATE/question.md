Hey, stop right there!

We use GitHub to track feature requests and bug reports. Please do not submit issues for questions about how to use features of Beat, how to set Beats up, best practices, or development related help.

However, we do want to help! Head on over to our official Beats forums and ask
your questions there. In additional to awesome, knowledgeable community
contributors, core Beats developers are on the forums every single day to help
you out.

The forums are here: https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats

We can't stop you from opening an issue here, but it will likely linger without a response for days or weeks before it is closed and we ask you to join us on the forums instead. Save yourself the time, and ask on the forums today.
