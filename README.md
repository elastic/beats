# Beats - Lightweight shippers for Elasticsearch & Logstash

The [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats) are lightweight processes,
written in Go, that you install on your servers to capture all sorts of
operational data like logs, operating system metrics or network packet data,
and to send it to Elasticsearch, either directly or via Logstash, so it can be
visualized with Kibana.

This repository contains libbeat and all the officially supported Beats, in the
following folders:

Folder  | Description
--- | ---
[libbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/libbeat) | The Go framework for creating new Beats
[Filebeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/filebeat) | Lightweight log forwarder to Logstash & Elasticsearch
[Heartbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/heartbeat) | Testing service availability using PING based on ICMP, TCP or higher level protocols
[Metricbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/metricbeat) | Fetches sets of metrics from the operating system and services
[Packetbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat) | Tap into your wire data
[Winlogbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/winlogbeat) | Sends Windows Event logs

In addition to the above Beats, which are officially supported by
[Elastic](elastic.co), the
community has created a set of other Beats that make use of libbeat but live
outside of this Github repository. We maintain a list of community Beats
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/master/community-beats.html).

## Documentation and Getting Help

You can find the documentation on the [elastic.co
site](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/index.html). If you
need help, you can open a topic on our [discuss
forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats).

## Contributing

We'd love working with you! You can help making the Beats better in many ways:
report issues, help us reproduce issues, fix bugs, add functionality, or even
create your own Beat.

Please start by reading our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

If you are creating a new Beat, you don't need to submit the code to this
repository. You can simply start working in a new repository and make use of
the libbeat packages, by following our [developer
guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/new-beat.html).
After you have a working prototype, open a pull request to add your Beat to the
list of [community
Beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/master/libbeat/docs/communitybeats.asciidoc).

## Building Beats from the Source

See our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for information about setting up your dev
environment to build Beats from the source.
