# [Packetbeat](http://packetbeat.com)

Packetbeat is an open source application monitoring and packet tracing system.
It works by sniffing the traffic between your application services, correlating
them into transactions and using Elasticsearch for analysing them and for
ad-hoc queries.

This repository contains the code for the Packetbeat agent.
