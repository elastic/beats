This changelog is intended for community Beat developers. It covers the major
breaking changes to the internal APIs in the official Beats and changes related
to developing a Beat like code generators or `fields.yml`. Only the major
changes will be covered in this changelog that are expected to affect community
developers. Each breaking change added here should have an explanation on how
other Beats should be migrated.

Note: This changelog documents the current changes which are not yet present in
an actual release.

=== Beats version HEAD
https://github.com/elastic/beats/compare/v7.0.0-rc2..master[Check the HEAD diff]

The list below covers the major changes between 7.0.0-rc2 and master only.

==== Breaking changes

- Move Fields from package libbeat/common to libbeat/mapping. {pull}11198[11198]
- For "metricbeat style" generated custom beats, the mage target `GoTestIntegration` has changed to `GoIntegTest` and `GoTestUnit` has changed to `GoUnitTest`. {pull}13341[13341]
- Build docker and kubernetes features only on supported platforms. {pull}13509[13509]
- Need to register new processors to be used in the JS processor in their `init` functions. {pull}13509[13509]
- The custom beat generator now uses mage instead of python, `mage GenerateCustomBeat` can be used to create a new beat, and `mage vendorUpdate` to update the vendored libbeat in a custom beat. {pull}13610[13610]
- Altered all remaining uses of mapval to use the renamed and enhanced version: https://github.com/elastic/go-lookslike[go-lookslike] instead, which is a separate project. The mapval tree is now gone. {pull}14165[14165]
- Move light modules to OSS. {pull}14369[14369]
- Deprecate test flags, `generate` and `update_expected`, in favor of `data`. {pull}15292[15292]
- Python 3 is required now to run python tests and tools. {pull}14798[14798]

==== Bugfixes

- Stop using `mage:import` in community beats. This was ignoring the vendorized beats directory for some mage targets, using the code available in GOPATH, this causes inconsistencies and compilation problems if the version of the code in the GOPATH is different to the vendored one. Use of `mage:import` will continue to be unsupported in custom beats till beats is migrated to go modules, or mage supports vendored dependencies. {issue}13998[13998] {pull}14162[14162]

==== Added

- Make the behavior of clientWorker and netClientWorker consistent when error is returned from publisher pipeline
- Metricset generator generates beta modules by default now. {pull}10657[10657]
- The `beat.Event` accessor methods now support `@metadata` keys. {pull}10761[10761]
- Assertion for documented fields in tests fails if any of the fields in the tested event is documented as an alias. {pull}10921[10921]
- Support for Logger in the Metricset base instance. {pull}11106[11106]
- Filebeat modules can now use ingest pipelines in YAML format. {pull}11209[11209]
- Prometheus helper for metricbeat contains now `Namespace` field for `prometheus.MetricsMappings` {pull}11424[11424]

- Deprecate setup cmds for `template` and `ilm-policy`. Add new setup cmd for `index-management`. {pull}12132[12132]
