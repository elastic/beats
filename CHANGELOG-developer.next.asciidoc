This changelog is intended for community Beat developers. It covers the major
breaking changes to the internal APIs in the official Beats and changes related
to developing a Beat like code generators or `fields.yml`. Only the major
changes will be covered in this changelog that are expected to affect community
developers. Each breaking change added here should have an explanation on how
other Beats should be migrated.

Note: This changelog documents the current changes which are not yet present in
an actual release.

=== Beats version HEAD
https://github.com/elastic/beats/compare/v7.0.0-rc2..master[Check the HEAD diff]

The list below covers the major changes between 7.0.0-rc2 and master only.

==== Breaking changes

- Move Fields from package libbeat/common to libbeat/mapping. {pull}11198[11198]
- For "metricbeat style" generated custom beats, the mage target `GoTestIntegration` has changed to `GoIntegTest` and `GoTestUnit` has changed to `GoUnitTest`. {pull}13341[13341]
- Build docker and kubernetes features only on supported platforms. {pull}13509[13509]
- Need to register new processors to be used in the JS processor in their `init` functions. {pull}13509[13509]
- The custom beat generator now uses mage instead of python, `mage GenerateCustomBeat` can be used to create a new beat, and `mage vendorUpdate` to update the vendored libbeat in a custom beat. {pull}13610[13610]
- Altered all remaining uses of mapval to use the renamed and enhanced version: https://github.com/elastic/go-lookslike[go-lookslike] instead, which is a separate project. The mapval tree is now gone. {pull}14165[14165]
- Move light modules to OSS. {pull}14369[14369]
- Deprecate test flags, `generate` and `update_expected`, in favor of `data`. {pull}15292[15292]
- Python 3 is required now to run python tests and tools. {pull}14798[14798]
- The type `memqueue.Broker` is no longer exported; instead of `memqueue.NewBroker`, call `memqueue.NewQueue` (which provides the same public interface). {pull}16667[16667]
- The disk spool types `spool.Spool` and `spool.Settings` have been renamed to the internal types `spool.diskSpool` and `spool.settings`. {pull}16693[16693]
- `queue.Eventer` has been renamed to `queue.ACKListener` {pull}16691[16691]
- Require logger as first parameter for `outputs.transport.transport#ProxyDialer` and `outputs.elasticsearch.client#BulkReadItemStatus`. {pull}16761[16761]
- The `libbeat/outputs/transport` package has been moved to `libbeat/common/transport`. {pull}16734[16734]
- The `libbeat/outputs/tls.go` file has been removed. All exported symbols in that file (`libbeat/outputs.*`) are now available as `libbeat/common/tlscommon.*`. {pull}16734[16734]
- The newly generated Beats are using go modules to manage dependencies. {pull}16288[16288]
- Extract Elasticsearch client logic from `outputs/elasticsearch` package into new `esclientleg` package. {pull}16150[16150]
- Rename `queue.BufferConfig.Events` to `queue.BufferConfig.MaxEvents`. {pull}17622[17622]
- Remove `queue.Feature` and replace `queue.RegisterType` with `queue.RegisterQueueType`. {pull}17666[17666]
- Introduce APM libbeat instrumentation. `Publish` method on `Client` interface now takes a Context as first argument. {pull}17938[17938]
- The way configuration files are generated has changed to make it easier to customize parts
  of the config without requiring changes to libbeat config templates. Generation is now
  fully based on Go text/template and no longer uses file concatenation to generate the config.
  Your magefile.go will require a change to adapt the devtool API. See the pull request for
  more details. {pull}18148[18148]
- The Elasticsearch client settings expect the API key to be raw (not base64-encoded). {issue}18939[18939] {pull}18945[18945]
- `management.ConfigManager` has been renamed to `management.Manager`. {pull}19114[19114]
- `UpdateStatus` has been added to the `management.Manager` interface. {pull}19114[19114]
- Remove `common.MapStrPointer` parameter from `cfgfile.Runnerfactory` interface. {pull}19135[19135]
- Replace `ACKCount`, `ACKEvents`, and `ACKLastEvent` callbacks with `ACKHandler` and interface in `beat.ClientConfig`. {pull}19632[19632]
- Remove global ACK handler support via `SetACKHandler` from publisher pipeline. {pull}19632[19632]
- Make implementing `Close` required for `reader.Reader` interfaces. {pull}20455[20455]
- Remove `NumCPU` as clients should update the CPU count on the fly in case of config changes in a VM. {pull}23154[23154]
- Remove Metricbeat EventFetcher and EventsFetcher interface. Use the reporter interface instead. {pull}25093[25093]
- Update Darwin build image to a debian 10 base that increases the MacOS SDK and minimum supported version used in build to 10.14. {issue}24193[24193]

==== Bugfixes

- Stop using `mage:import` in community beats. This was ignoring the vendorized beats directory for some mage targets, using the code available in GOPATH, this causes inconsistencies and compilation problems if the version of the code in the GOPATH is different to the vendored one. Use of `mage:import` will continue to be unsupported in custom beats till beats is migrated to go modules, or mage supports vendored dependencies. {issue}13998[13998] {pull}14162[14162]
- Metricbeat module builders call host parser only once when instantiating light modules. {pull}20149[20149]
- Fix export dashboard command when running against Elastic Cloud hosted Kibana. {pull}22746[22746]
