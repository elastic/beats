##################$$$###### Filebeat Configuration ############################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see filebeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/index.html

#=========================== Filebeat prospectors =============================

# List of prospectors to fetch data.
filebeat.prospectors:
# Each - is a prospector. Most options can be set at the prospector level, so
# you can use different prospectors for various configurations.
# Below are the prospector specific configurations.

# Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided.
# The different types cannot be mixed in one prospector
#
# Possible options are:
# * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
# * stdin: Reads the standard in

#------------------------------ Log prospector --------------------------------
- input_type: log

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
  # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
  # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
  # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
  paths:
    - /var/log/*.log
    #- c:\programdata\elasticsearch\logs\*

  # Configure the file encoding for reading files with international characters
  # following the W3C recommendation for HTML5 (http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding).
  # Some sample encodings:
  #   plain, utf-8, utf-16be-bom, utf-16be, utf-16le, big5, gb18030, gbk,
  #    hz-gb-2312, euc-kr, euc-jp, iso-2022-jp, shift-jis, ...
  #encoding: plain


  # Exclude lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It drops the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
  # exclude_lines. By default, no lines are dropped.
  #exclude_lines: ["^DBG"]

  # Include lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It exports the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
  # exclude_lines. By default, all the lines are exported.
  #include_lines: ["^ERR", "^WARN"]

  # Exclude files. A list of regular expressions to match. Filebeat drops the files that
  # are matching any regular expression from the list. By default, no files are dropped.
  #exclude_files: [".gz$"]

  # Optional additional fields. These field can be freely picked
  # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
  #fields:
  #  level: debug
  #  review: 1

  # Set to true to store the additional fields as top level fields instead
  # of under the "fields" sub-dictionary. In case of name conflicts with the
  # fields added by Filebeat itself, the custom fields overwrite the default
  # fields.
  #fields_under_root: false

  # Ignore files which were modified more then the defined timespan in the past.
  # ignore_older is disabled by default, so no files are ignored by setting it to 0.
  # Time strings like 2h (2 hours), 5m (5 minutes) can be used.
  #ignore_older: 0

  # Type to be published in the 'type' field. For Elasticsearch output,
  # the type defines the document type these entries should be stored
  # in. Default: log
  #document_type: log

  # How often the prospector checks for new files in the paths that are specified
  # for harvesting. Specify 1s to scan the directory as frequently as possible
  # without causing Filebeat to scan too frequently. Default: 10s.
  #scan_frequency: 10s

  # Defines the buffer size every harvester uses when fetching the file
  #harvester_buffer_size: 16384

  # Maximum number of bytes a single log event can have
  # All bytes after max_bytes are discarded and not sent. The default is 10MB.
  # This is especially useful for multiline log messages which can get large.
  #max_bytes: 10485760

  ### JSON configuration

  # Decode JSON options. Enable this if your logs are structured in JSON.
  # JSON key on which to apply the line filtering and multiline settings. This key
  # must be top level and its value must be string, otherwise it is ignored. If
  # no text key is defined, the line filtering and multiline features cannot be used.
  #json.message_key:

  # By default, the decoded JSON is placed under a "json" key in the output document.
  # If you enable this setting, the keys are copied top level in the output document.
  #json.keys_under_root: false

  # If keys_under_root and this setting are enabled, then the values from the decoded
  # JSON object overwrite the fields that Filebeat normally adds (type, source, offset, etc.)
  # in case of conflicts.
  #json.overwrite_keys: false

  # If this setting is enabled, Filebeat adds a "json_error" key in case of JSON
  # unmarshaling errors or when a text key is defined in the configuration but cannot
  # be used.
  #json.add_error_key: false

  ### Multiline options

  # Mutiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
  # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

  # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
  #multiline.pattern: ^\[

  # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
  #multiline.negate: false

  # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
  # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
  # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
  #multiline.match: after

  # The maximum number of lines that are combined to one event.
  # In case there are more the max_lines the additional lines are discarded.
  # Default is 500
  #multiline.max_lines: 500

  # After the defined timeout, an multiline event is sent even if no new pattern was found to start a new event
  # Default is 5s.
  #multiline.timeout: 5s

  # Setting tail_files to true means filebeat starts reading new files at the end
  # instead of the beginning. If this is used in combination with log rotation
  # this can mean that the first entries of a new file are skipped.
  #tail_files: false

  # Experimental: If symlinks is enabled, symlinks are opened and harvested. The harvester is openening the
  # original for harvesting but will report the symlink name as source.
  #symlinks: false

  # Backoff values define how aggressively filebeat crawls new files for updates
  # The default values can be used in most cases. Backoff defines how long it is waited
  # to check a file again after EOF is reached. Default is 1s which means the file
  # is checked every second if new lines were added. This leads to a near real time crawling.
  # Every time a new line appears, backoff is reset to the initial value.
  #backoff: 1s

  # Max backoff defines what the maximum backoff time is. After having backed off multiple times
  # from checking the files, the waiting time will never exceed max_backoff independent of the
  # backoff factor. Having it set to 10s means in the worst case a new line can be added to a log
  # file after having backed off multiple times, it takes a maximum of 10s to read the new line
  #max_backoff: 10s

  # The backoff factor defines how fast the algorithm backs off. The bigger the backoff factor,
  # the faster the max_backoff value is reached. If this value is set to 1, no backoff will happen.
  # The backoff value will be multiplied each time with the backoff_factor until max_backoff is reached
  #backoff_factor: 2

  # Experimental: Max number of harvesters that are started in parallel.
  # Default is 0 which means unlimited
  #harvester_limit: 0

  ### Harvester closing options

  # Close inactive closes the file handler after the predefined period.
  # The period starts when the last line of the file was, not the file ModTime.
  # Time strings like 2h (2 hours), 5m (5 minutes) can be used.
  #close_inactive: 5m

  # Close renamed closes a file handler when the file is renamed or rotated.
  # Note: Potential data loss. Make sure to read and understand the docs for this option.
  #close_renamed: false

  # When enabling this option, a file handler is closed immediately in case a file can't be found
  # any more. In case the file shows up again later, harvesting will continue at the last known position
  # after scan_frequency.
  #close_removed: true

  # Closes the file handler as soon as the harvesters reaches the end of the file.
  # By default this option is disabled.
  # Note: Potential data loss. Make sure to read and understand the docs for this option.
  #close_eof: false

  ### State options

  # Files for the modification data is older then clean_inactive the state from the registry is removed
  # By default this is disabled.
  #clean_inactive: 0

  # Removes the state for file which cannot be found on disk anymore immediately
  #clean_removed: true

  # Close timeout closes the harvester after the predefined time.
  # This is independent if the harvester did finish reading the file or not.
  # By default this option is disabled.
  # Note: Potential data loss. Make sure to read and understand the docs for this option.
  #close_timeout: 0

#----------------------------- Stdin prospector -------------------------------
# Configuration to use stdin input
#- input_type: stdin

#========================= Filebeat global options ============================

# Event count spool threshold - forces network flush if exceeded
#filebeat.spool_size: 2048

# Enable async publisher pipeline in filebeat (Experimental!)
#filebeat.publish_async: false

# Defines how often the spooler is flushed. After idle_timeout the spooler is
# Flush even though spool_size is not reached.
#filebeat.idle_timeout: 5s

# Name of the registry file. If a relative path is used, it is considered relative to the
# data path.
#filebeat.registry_file: ${path.data}/registry

#
# These config files must have the full filebeat config part inside, but only
# the prospector part is processed. All global options like spool_size are ignored.
# The config_dir MUST point to a different directory then where the main filebeat config file is in.
#filebeat.config_dir:

# How long filebeat waits on shutdown for the publisher to finish.
# Default is 0, not waiting.
#filebeat.shutdown_timeout: 0
