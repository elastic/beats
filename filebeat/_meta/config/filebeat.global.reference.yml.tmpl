# The permissions mask to apply on registry data, and meta files. The default
# value is 0600.  Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in

# The timeout value that controls when registry entries are written to disk
# (flushed). When an unwritten update exceeds this value, it triggers a write
# to disk. When flush is set to 0s, the registry is written to disk after each
# batch of events has been published successfully. The default value is 0s.
#filebeat.registry.flush: 0s


# Starting with Filebeat 7.0, the registry uses a new directory format to store
# Filebeat state. After you upgrade, Filebeat will automatically migrate a 6.x
# registry file to use the new directory format. If you changed
# filebeat.registry.path while upgrading, set filebeat.registry.migrate_file to
# point to the old registry file.

# By default Ingest pipelines are not updated if a pipeline with the same ID
# already exists. If this option is enabled Filebeat overwrites pipelines
