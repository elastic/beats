# Registry data path. If a relative path is used, it is considered relative to the
# data path.
#filebeat.registry.path: ${path.data}/registry

# The permissions mask to apply on registry data and meta files. The default
# value is 0600.  Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in
# octal notation.  This option is not supported on Windows.
#filebeat.registry.file_permissions: 0600

# The timeout value that controls when registry entries are written to the disk
# (flushed). When an unwritten update exceeds this value, it triggers a write
# to disk. When flush is set to 0s, the registry is written to disk after each
# batch of events has been published successfully. The default value is 1s.
#filebeat.registry.flush: 1s

# The interval which to run the registry clean up
#filebeat.registry.cleanup_interval: 5m

# Starting with Filebeat 7.0, the registry uses a new directory format to store
# Filebeat state. After you upgrade, Filebeat will automatically migrate a 6.x
# registry file to use the new directory format. If you changed
# filebeat.registry.path while upgrading, set filebeat.registry.migrate_file to
# point to the old registry file.
#filebeat.registry.migrate_file: ${path.data}/registry

# The storage backend for the registry. Supported values are "memlog" and
# "bbolt". The default is "memlog", which uses an in-memory log with periodic
# disk flushing. The "bbolt" backend uses a bbolt (BoltDB) database for
# persistent on-disk storage with support for compaction and TTL-based cleanup.
#filebeat.registry.backend: memlog

# ----------------------- Bbolt backend settings -------------------------------
# WARNING: The bbolt backend is EXPERIMENTAL and may change or be removed in
# future releases. Do not use in production without understanding the risks.
#
# These settings apply only when filebeat.registry.backend is set to "bbolt".
# The database files are stored under the registry.path directory.
# Configuration parameter names are aligned with the OpenTelemetry
# filestorage extension for future compatibility.

# Timeout for obtaining a file lock on the bbolt database file. Default: 1s.
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.timeout: 1s

# If true, fsync is called after each database write. This ensures data is
# flushed to disk but reduces write throughput. Default: false.
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.fsync: false

# How long entries are kept before being removed by periodic cleanup.
# A zero value disables TTL-based cleanup. Works together with
# bbolt.compaction.cleanup_interval. Default: 0 (disabled).
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.ttl: 0

# If true, database compaction runs on every start. Compaction rewrites the
# database to reclaim unused disk space. Default: false.
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.compaction.on_start: false

# If true, enables online rebound compaction. When the database grows past
# rebound_needed_threshold_mib and later shrinks below
# rebound_trigger_threshold_mib, compaction is triggered automatically.
# Default: false.
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.compaction.on_rebound: false

# Minimum total allocated database size (in MiB) to mark the need for
# rebound compaction. Default: 100.
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.compaction.rebound_needed_threshold_mib: 100

# When rebound compaction is needed, it triggers once the live data size
# drops below this value (in MiB). Default: 10.
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.compaction.rebound_trigger_threshold_mib: 10

# Maximum number of items copied per transaction during compaction.
# Default: 65536.
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.compaction.max_transaction_size: 65536

# How often to check whether rebound compaction conditions are met.
# Only used when on_rebound is true. Default: 5s.
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.compaction.check_interval: 5s

# If true, leftover temporary files from a previous compaction that was
# interrupted (e.g. by a crash) are removed on start. Default: false.
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.compaction.cleanup_on_start: false

# How often to run TTL-based entry cleanup. Only effective when bbolt.ttl
# is also set to a positive value. A zero value disables periodic cleanup.
# Default: 0 (disabled).
#filebeat.registry.bbolt.compaction.cleanup_interval: 0

# By default Ingest pipelines are not updated if a pipeline with the same ID
# already exists. If this option is enabled Filebeat overwrites pipelines
# every time a new Elasticsearch connection is established.
#filebeat.overwrite_pipelines: false

# How long filebeat waits on shutdown for the publisher to finish.
# Default is 0, not waiting.
#filebeat.shutdown_timeout: 0

# Enable filebeat config reloading
#filebeat.config:
  #inputs:
