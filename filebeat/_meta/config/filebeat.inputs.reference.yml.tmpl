#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================

# List of inputs to fetch data.
filebeat.inputs:
# Each - is an input. Most options can be set at the input level, so
# you can use different inputs for various configurations.
# Below are the input specific configurations.

# Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided.
# The different types cannot be mixed in one input
#
# Possible options are:
# * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
# * filestream: Improved version of log input
# * stdin: Reads the standard in

#------------------------------ Log input --------------------------------
- type: log

  # Change to true to enable this input configuration.
  enabled: false

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
  # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
  # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
  # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
  paths:

  # Configure the file encoding for reading files with international characters
  # following the W3C recommendation for HTML5 (http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding).
  # Some sample encodings:
  #   plain, utf-8, utf-16be-bom, utf-16be, utf-16le, big5, gb18030, gbk,
  #    hz-gb-2312, euc-kr, euc-jp, iso-2022-jp, shift-jis, ...

  # Exclude lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It drops the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
  # exclude_lines. By default, no lines are dropped.
  #exclude_lines: ['^DBG']

  # Include lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It exports the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
  # exclude_lines. By default, all the lines are exported.
  #include_lines: ['^ERR', '^WARN']

  # Exclude files. A list of regular expressions to match. Filebeat drops the files that
  # are matching any regular expression from the list. By default, no files are dropped.
  #exclude_files: ['.gz$']

  # Method to determine if two files are the same or not. By default
  # the Beat considers two files the same if their inode and device id are the same.
  #file_identity.native: ~

  # Optional additional fields. These fields can be freely picked
  # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
  #fields:
  #  level: debug
  #  review: 1

  # Set to true to store the additional fields as top level fields instead
  # of under the "fields" sub-dictionary. In case of name conflicts with the
  # fields added by Filebeat itself, the custom fields overwrite the default
  # fields.
  #fields_under_root: false

  # Set to true to publish fields with null values in events.
  #keep_null: false

  # By default, all events contain `host.name`. This option can be set to true
  # to disable the addition of this field to all events. The default value is
  # false.
  #publisher_pipeline.disable_host: false

  # Ignore files which were modified more then the defined timespan in the past.
  # ignore_older is disabled by default, so no files are ignored by setting it to 0.

  ### Recursive glob configuration

  # Expand "**" patterns into regular glob patterns.
  #recursive_glob.enabled: true

  ### JSON configuration

  # Decode JSON options. Enable this if your logs are structured in JSON.
  # JSON key on which to apply the line filtering and multiline settings. This key
  # must be top level and its value must be string, otherwise it is ignored. If
  # no text key is defined, the line filtering and multiline features cannot be used.
  #json.message_key:

  # By default, the decoded JSON is placed under a "json" key in the output document.
  # If you enable this setting, the keys are copied top level in the output document.
  #json.keys_under_root: false

  # If keys_under_root and this setting are enabled, then the values from the decoded
  # JSON object overwrite the fields that Filebeat normally adds (type, source, offset, etc.)
  # in case of conflicts.
  #json.overwrite_keys: false

  # If this setting is enabled, then keys in the decoded JSON object will be recursively
  # de-dotted, and expanded into a hierarchical object structure.
  # For example, `{"a.b.c": 123}` would be expanded into `{"a":{"b":{"c":123}}}`.
  #json.expand_keys: false

  # If this setting is enabled, Filebeat adds a "error.message" and "error.key: json" key in case of JSON
  # unmarshaling errors or when a text key is defined in the configuration but cannot
  # be used.
  #json.add_error_key: false

  ### Multiline options

  # Multiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
  # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

  # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
  #multiline.pattern: ^\[

  # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
  #multiline.negate: false

  # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
  # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
  # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
  #multiline.match: after

  # The maximum number of lines that are combined to one event.
  # In case there are more the max_lines the additional lines are discarded.
  # Default is 500
  #multiline.max_lines: 500

  # After the defined timeout, an multiline event is sent even if no new pattern was found to start a new event
  # Default is 5s.
  #multiline.timeout: 5s

  # To aggregate constant number of lines into a single event use the count mode of multiline.
  #multiline.type: count

  # The number of lines to aggregate into a single event.
  #multiline.count_lines: 3

  # Do not add new line character when concatenating lines.
  #multiline.skip_newline: false

  # Setting tail_files to true means filebeat starts reading new files at the end
  # instead of the beginning. If this is used in combination with log rotation
  # this can mean that the first entries of a new file are skipped.
  #tail_files: false

  # The Ingest Node pipeline ID associated with this input. If this is set, it
  # overwrites the pipeline option from the Elasticsearch output.
  #pipeline:

  # If symlinks is enabled, symlinks are opened and harvested. The harvester is opening the
  # original for harvesting but will report the symlink name as source.
  #symlinks: false

  # Backoff values define how aggressively filebeat crawls new files for updates
  # The default values can be used in most cases. Backoff defines how long it is waited
  # to check a file again after EOF is reached. Default is 1s which means the file
  # is checked every second if new lines were added. This leads to a near real time crawling.
  # Every time a new line appears, backoff is reset to the initial value.
  #backoff: 1s

  # Max backoff defines what the maximum backoff time is. After having backed off multiple times
  # from checking the files, the waiting time will never exceed max_backoff independent of the
  # backoff factor. Having it set to 10s means in the worst case a new line can be added to a log
  # file after having backed off multiple times, it takes a maximum of 10s to read the new line
  #max_backoff: 10s

  # The backoff factor defines how fast the algorithm backs off. The bigger the backoff factor,
  # the faster the max_backoff value is reached. If this value is set to 1, no backoff will happen.
  # The backoff value will be multiplied each time with the backoff_factor until max_backoff is reached
  #backoff_factor: 2

  # Max number of harvesters that are started in parallel.
  # Default is 0 which means unlimited
  #harvester_limit: 0

  ### Harvester closing options
