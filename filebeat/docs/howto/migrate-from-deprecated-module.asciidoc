== Migrating from a Deprecated Filebeat Module

If a Filebeat module has been deprecated, there are a few options available for
a path forward:

1. Migrate to an Elastic integration, if available. The deprecation notice will
link to an appropriate integration, if one exists.

2. https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/migrate-beats-to-agent.html[Migrate to Elastic Agent]
for ingesting logs. If a specific integration for the vendor/product does not
exist, then one of the custom integrations can be used for ingesting events. A
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/data-streams-pipeline-tutorial.html[custom pipeline]
may also be attached to the integration for further processing.

    - https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/udp[Custom UDP] - Collect events from a listening UDP port
    - https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/winlog[Custom Windows Event] - Collect events from a Windows Event Log channel

3. Migrate to a different Filebeat module. In some cases, a Filebeat module may
be superseded by a new module. The deprecation notice will link to an appropriate
module, if one exists.

4. Use a custom Filebeat input, processors, and ingest pipeline (if necessary).
