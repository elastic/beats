== Get started: install and configure {beatname_uc}

//TODO: We need to add a separate topic that provides a summary of the different
//ways to parse log lines: ingest node, dissect processor, Logstash, etc. That
//is beyond the scope of a quick start, IMO.

<titleabbrev>Get started</titleabbrev>

This guide describes how to get started quickly with log collection.
You'll learn how to:

* install {beatname_uc} on each system you want to monitor
* specify the location of your log files
* parse log data into fields and send it to {es}
* visualize the log data in {kib}

//REVIEWERS: I think that moving up these dashboards makes the value FB adds
//more obvious. Should I do this with all the GS guides?

=== Before you begin

You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and
managing it.

// TODO: We might want to provide the instructions for spinning up a deployment
// here. See
// https://github.com/elastic/docs/pull/1815/files#diff-934228d98950ff95c8c53444966daeaeR10
// Or link to the topic that's available for cloud.

[[installation]]
=== Step 1: Install {beatname_uc}

//REVIEWERS: We don't currently say anything about licensing here. Should we?

Install {beatname_uc} on all the servers you want to monitor.

To download and install {beatname_uc}, use the commands that work with your
system:

include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/install-widget.asciidoc[]

==== Other installation options

* <<setup-repositories>>
* https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/{beatname_lc}[Download page] 
* <<running-on-docker>>
* <<running-on-kubernetes>> 
* <<running-on-cloudfoundry>>

[[set-connection]]
=== Step 2: Set the connection information

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/connecting-to-es.asciidoc[]

[[enable-modules]]
=== Step 3: Enable and configure data collection modules

{beatname_uc} uses modules to collect and parse log data.

. Identify the modules you need to enable. To see a list of available
<<filebeat-modules,modules>>, run:
+
--
include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/list-modules-widget.asciidoc[]
--
+
Can't find a module for your file type? You'll need to
<<configuration-filebeat-options,configure the input>> manually.

. From the installation directory, enable one or more modules. For example, the
following command enables the `system`, `nginx`, and `mysql` module
configs:
+
--
include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/enable-modules-widget.asciidoc[]
--

. In the module configs under `modules.d`, change the module settings to match
your environment.
+
The default log locations are set based on the OS. If your logs aren't in
default locations, set the `paths` variable. For example:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
- module: nginx
  access:
    var.paths: ["/var/log/nginx/access.log*"] <1> 
----
--

[[setup-assets]]
=== Step 4: Set up assets

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/setup.asciidoc[]

This step does not load the ingest pipelines used to parse log lines. By
default, ingest pipelines are set up automatically the first time you run the
module and connect to {es}. If you're sending events to {ls}, you need to
<<load-ingest-pipelines>>.

// REVIEWERS: I wonder if we should even mention Logstash in this guide. I think
// it might be better to have a full topic in the  how-to section that describes
// how to route events through Logstash (then we could cover all the
// requirements without exposing users to a product they might not need).

[float]
[[start]]
=== Step 5: Start {beatname_uc}

Before starting {beatname_uc}, modify the user credentials in
+{beatname_lc}.yml+ and specify a user who has restricted privileges,
especially if you're running {beatname_uc} in a production environment.
For more information, see <<privileges-to-publish-events>>.

To start {beatname_uc}, run:

include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/start-widget.asciidoc[]

{beatname_uc} should begin streaming events to {es}.

[float]
[[view-data]]
=== Step 6: View your data in {kib}
