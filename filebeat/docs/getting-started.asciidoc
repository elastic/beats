== {beatname_uc} quick start: installation and configuration

++++
<titleabbrev>Quick start: installation and configuration</titleabbrev>
++++

This guide describes how to get started quickly with log collection.
You'll learn how to:

* install {beatname_uc} on each system you want to monitor
* specify the location of your log files
* parse log data into fields and send it to {es}
* visualize the log data in {kib}

=== Before you begin

You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and
managing it.

[[installation]]
=== Step 1: Install {beatname_uc}

Install {beatname_uc} on all the servers you want to monitor.

To download and install {beatname_uc}, use the commands that work with your
system:

include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/install-widget.asciidoc[]

==== Other installation options

* <<setup-repositories,APT or YUM>>
* https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/{beatname_lc}[Download page] 
* <<running-on-docker,Docker>>
* <<running-on-kubernetes,Kubernetes>> 
* <<running-on-cloudfoundry,Cloud Foundry>>

=== Step 2: Connect to the {stack}

[[enable-modules]]
=== Step 3: Enable and configure data collection modules

{beatname_uc} uses modules to collect and parse log data.

. Identify the modules you need to enable. To see a list of available
<<filebeat-modules,modules>>, run:
+
--
include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/list-modules-widget.asciidoc[]
--
+
Can't find a module for your file type? Skip this section and
<<configuration-filebeat-options,configure the input>> manually.

. From the installation directory, enable one or more modules. For example, the
following command enables the `system`, `nginx`, and `mysql` module
configs:
+
--
include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/enable-modules-widget.asciidoc[]
--

. In the module configs under `modules.d`, change the module settings to match
your environment.
+
For example, log locations are set based on the OS. If your logs aren't in
default locations, set the `paths` variable:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
- module: nginx
  access:
    var.paths: ["/var/log/nginx/access.log*"] <1> 
----
--

To see the full list of variables for a module, see the documentation under
<<filebeat-modules>>.

[[setup-application-logs]]
=== Step 4: Ingest application logs

This section is about best practices for ingesting logs from your own applications,
as well as for off-the-shelf applications for which we don't have suitable built-in modules.

Although you can ingest raw plain-text logs, we recommend you to structure
your logs on ingest time.
This lets you extract fields such as the log level and exception stack traces.

If you can change the log output of your application,
we recommend configuring your application to use the log formatters
provided by {ecs-logging-ref}/intro.html[ECS logging].
These plugins format your logs into ECS-compatible JSON.
This makes the configuration particularly easy as you don't have to
manually parse your logs.

If it is not possible to configure the logging for your application or if
there is no appropriate ECS logging plugin for your language or preferred
logging framework, you will need to manually
<<configuring-ingest-node, parse the logs using ingest node processors>>.


[float]
[[setup-assets]]
=== Step 5: Set up assets

{beatname_uc} comes with predefined assets for parsing, indexing, and
visualizing your data. To load these assets:

. Make sure the user specified in +{beatname_lc}.yml+ is
<<privileges-to-setup-beats,authorized to set up {beatname_uc}>>.

. From the installation directory, run:
+
--
include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/setup-widget.asciidoc[]
--
+
`-e` is optional and sends output to standard error instead of the configured log output.

This step loads the recommended {ref}/indices-templates.html[index template] for writing to {es}
and deploys the sample dashboards for visualizing the data in {kib}.

This step does not load the ingest pipelines used to parse log lines. By
default, ingest pipelines are set up automatically the first time you run the
module and connect to {es}.

[TIP]
=====
A connection to {es} (or {ess}) is required to set up the initial
environment. If you're using a different output, such as {ls}, see:

* <<load-template-manually>>
* <<load-kibana-dashboards>>
* <<load-ingest-pipelines>>

[[start]]
=== Step 5: Start {beatname_uc}

Before starting {beatname_uc}, modify the user credentials in
+{beatname_lc}.yml+ and specify a user who is
<<privileges-to-publish-events,authorized to publish events>>.

To start {beatname_uc}, run:

// tag::start-step[]
:requires-sudo:
include::{libbeat-dir}/tab-widgets/start-widget.asciidoc[]
:requires-sudo!:
// end::start-step[]

{beatname_uc} should begin streaming events to {es}.

[float]
[[view-data]]
=== Step 6: View your data in {kib}

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/opendashboards.asciidoc[tag=open-dashboards-intro]

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/opendashboards.asciidoc[tag=open-dashboards]

[float]
=== What's next?

Now that you have your logs streaming into {es}, learn how to unify your logs,
metrics, uptime, and application performance data.
