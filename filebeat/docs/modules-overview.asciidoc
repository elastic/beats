== Modules overview

{beatname_uc} modules simplify the collection, parsing, and visualization of common
log formats.

A typical module (say, for the Nginx logs) is composed of one or
more filesets (in the case of Nginx, `access` and `error`). A fileset contains
the following:

* {beatname_uc} input configurations, which contain the default paths where to
  look for the log files. These default paths depend on the operating system.
  The {beatname_uc} configuration is also responsible with stitching together
  multiline events when needed.

* {es} {ref}/ingest.html[Ingest Node] pipeline definition,
  which is used to parse the log lines.

* Fields definitions, which are used to configure {es} with the
  correct types for each field. They also contain short descriptions for each
  of the fields.

* Sample {kib} dashboards, when available, that can be used to visualize the
log files.

{beatname_uc} automatically adjusts these configurations based on your environment
and loads them to the respective {stack} components.
