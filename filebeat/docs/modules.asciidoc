This section contains an <<filebeat-modules-overview,overview>> of the Filebeat
modules feature as well as details about each of the currently supported
modules.

Filebeat modules require Elasticsearch 5.2 or later.

NOTE: While {filebeat} modules are still supported, we recommend {agent} integrations over {filebeat} modules. Integrations provide a streamlined way to connect data from a variety of vendors to the {stack}. Refer to the https://www.elastic.co/integrations/data-integrations[full list of integrations]. For more information, please refer to the {fleet-guide}/beats-agent-comparison.html[{beats} vs {agent} comparison documentation].
