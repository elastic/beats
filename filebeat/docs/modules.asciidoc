This section contains an <<filebeat-modules-overview,overview>> of the Filebeat
modules feature as well as details about each of the currently supported
modules.

Filebeat modules require Elasticsearch 5.2 or later.

NOTE: While {filebeat} modules are still supported, we recommend {agent} integrations over {filebeat} modules. Integrations provide a streamlined way to connect data from a variety of vendors to the {stack}. Refer to the full list of integrations [here](https://www.elastic.co/integrations/data-integrations). For more information, please refer to the [{beats} vs {agents} comparison](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/beats-agent-comparison.html) documentation.
