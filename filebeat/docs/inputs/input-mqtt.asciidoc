=== MQTT input

++++
<titleabbrev>MQTT</titleabbrev>
++++

Use the `MQTT` input to read data transmitted using lightweight messaging protocol
for small and mobile devices, optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks.

This input connects to the MQTT broker, subscribes to selected topics and parses data
into common message lines. Everything happens before line filtering, multiline, and JSON decoding,
so this input can be used in combination with those settings.

Example configuration:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
{beatname_lc}.inputs:
- type: mqtt
  hosts: <1>
    - tcp://broker:1883
    - ssl://secure_broker:8883
  topics: <2>
    - sample_topic
----

<1> `hosts` are required.

<2> `topics` are required.

All other settings are optional.

==== Configuration options

The `mqtt` input supports the following configuration options plus the
<<{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-common-options>> described later.

===== `hosts`

A list of MQTT brokers to connect to.

===== `topics`

A list of topics to subscribe to and read from.

===== `qos`

An agreement level between the sender of a message and the receiver of a message that defines the guarantee of delivery.

There are 3 QoS levels in MQTT. Defaults to `0`:

* At most once (`0`),
* At least once (`1`),
* Exactly once (`2`).

===== `client_id`

A unique identifier of each MQTT client connecting to a MQTT broker.

===== `username`

A client username used for authentication provided on the application level by the MQTT protocol.

===== `password`

A client password used for authentication provided on the application level by the MQTT protocol.

===== `clean_session`

The `clean_session` flag indicates whether the client wants to establish a persistent session with the broker. 
The default is `true`.

When `clean_session` is set to false, the session is considered to be persistent. The broker stores all subscriptions for 
the client and all missed messages for the client that subscribed with a Quality of Service (QoS) level 1 or 2. 

In contrast, when `clean_session` is set to true, the broker doesnâ€™t retain any information for the client 
and discards any previous state from any persistent session.

===== `ssl`

Configuration options for SSL parameters like the certificate, key and the certificate authorities
to use.

See <<configuration-ssl>> for more information.
