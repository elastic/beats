[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-unix-max-message-size"]
==== `max_message_size`

The maximum size of the message received over the socket. The default is `20MiB`.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-unix-path"]
==== `path`

The path to the Unix socket that will receive events.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-unix-socket-type"]
==== `socket_type`

The type to of the Unix socket that will receive events. Valid values
are `stream` and `datagram`. The default is `stream`.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-unix-group"]
==== `group`

The group ownership of the Unix socket that will be created by Filebeat.
The default is the primary group name for the user Filebeat is running as.
This option is ignored on Windows.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-unix-mode"]
==== `mode`

The file mode of the Unix socket that will be created by Filebeat. This is
expected to be a file mode as an octal string. The default value is the system
default (generally `0755`).

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-unix-framing"]
==== `framing`

Specify the framing used to split incoming events.  Can be one of
`delimiter` or `rfc6587`.  `delimiter` uses the characters specified
in `line_delimiter` to split the incoming events.  `rfc6587` supports
octet counting and non-transparent framing as described in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6587[RFC6587].  `line_delimiter` is
used to split the events in non-transparent framing.  The default is `delimiter`.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-unix-line-delimiter"]
==== `line_delimiter`

Specify the characters used to split the incoming events. The default is '\n'.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-unix-max-connections"]
==== `max_connections`

The at most number of connections to accept at any given point in time.

[float]
[id="{beatname_lc}-input-{type}-unix-timeout"]
==== `timeout`

The number of seconds of inactivity before a connection is closed. The default is `300s`.
