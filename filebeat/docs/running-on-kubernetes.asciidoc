=== Running Filebeat on Kubernetes

Filebeat <<running-on-docker,Docker images>> can be used on Kubernetes to
retrieve and ship container logs.

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

However, version {stack-version} of {beatname_uc} has not yet been
released, so no Docker image is currently available for this version.

==== Kubernetes deploy manifests

By deploying Filebeat as a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/[DaemonSet]
we ensure we get a running instance on each node of the cluster.

Docker logs host folder (`/var/lib/docker/containers`) is mounted on the Filebeat
container. Filebeat will start an input for these files and start harvesting
them as they appear.

Everything is deployed under `kube-system` namespace, you can change that by
updating the YAML file.

To get the manifests just run:

["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/beats/{doc-branch}/deploy/kubernetes/filebeat-kubernetes.yaml
------------------------------------------------

[WARNING]
=======================================
If you are using Kubernetes 1.7 or earlier: {beatname_uc} uses a hostPath volume to persist internal data, it's located
under /var/lib/{beatname_lc}-data. The manifest uses folder autocreation (`DirectoryOrCreate`), which was introduced in
Kubernetes 1.8. You will need to remove `type: DirectoryOrCreate` from the manifest and create the host folder yourself.
=======================================

==== Settings

Some parameters are exposed in the manifest to configure logs destination, by
default they will use an existing Elasticsearch deploy if it's present, but you
may want to change that behavior, so just edit the YAML file and modify them:

["source", "yaml", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
- name: ELASTICSEARCH_HOST
  value: elasticsearch
- name: ELASTICSEARCH_PORT
  value: "9200"
- name: ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME
  value: elastic
- name: ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD
  value: changeme
------------------------------------------------

[float]
==== Deploy

To deploy Filebeat to Kubernetes just run:

["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
kubectl create -f filebeat-kubernetes.yaml
------------------------------------------------

Then you should be able to check the status by running:

["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
$ kubectl --namespace=kube-system get ds/filebeat

NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE-SELECTOR   AGE
filebeat   32        32        0         32           0           <none>          1m
------------------------------------------------

Logs should start flowing to Elasticsearch, all annotated with <<add-kubernetes-metadata>>
processor.
