== Office 365 module

beta[]

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/integration-link.asciidoc[]

This is a module for Office 365 logs received via one of the Office 365 API
endpoints. It currently supports user, admin, system, and policy actions and
events from Office 365 and Azure AD activity logs exposed by the Office 365
Management Activity API.

The {plugins}/ingest-geoip.html[ingest-geoip] and
{plugins}/ingest-user-agent.html[ingest-user_agent] Elasticsearch plugins are
required to run this module.

==== `audit` fileset settings

The `audit` fileset uses the Office 365 Management Activity API to retrieve
audit messages from Office 365 and Azure AD activity logs. These are the same
logs that are available under _Audit_ _Log_ _Search_ in the _Security_ _and_
_Compliance_ _Center._

[float]
===== Setup

To use this fileset you need to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off?view=o365-worldwide#turn-on-audit-log-search[enable Audit Log Search]
 and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/get-started-with-office-365-management-apis#register-your-application-in-azure-ad[register an application in Azure AD.]

Once this application is registered note the _Application (client) ID_ and the
_Directory (tenant) ID._ Then configure the authentication in the _Certificates & Secrets_
section.


Example configuration `o365.yml` using client-secret authentication:

[source,yaml]
----
  audit:
    enabled: true
    var.application_id: "<My Azure AD Application ID>"
    var.tenants:
      - id: "<My Tenant ID>"
        name: "mytenant.onmicrosoft.com"
    var.client_secret: "<My client secret>"
----

Certificate-based authentication is specially useful when monitoring multiple
tenants. Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
  audit:
    enabled: true
    var.application_id: "<My Azure AD Application ID>"
    var.tenants:
      - id: "<Tenant A ID>"
        name: "tenantA.onmicrosoft.com"
      - id: "<Tenant B ID>"
        name: "tenantB.onmicrosoft.com"
    var.certificate: "/path/to/certificate.pem"
    var.key: "/path/to/private_key.pem"
    var.key_passphrase: "my_passphrase" # (optional) for encrypted keys
----

Finally you need to add permissions in the _API permissions_ section and grant
it admin consent. Click on _Add permission_ and select
_Office 365 Management APIs._ The needed permissions are:

- User.Read
- ActivityFeed.Read
- ActivityFeed.ReadDlp
- ServiceHealth.Read

Once the required permissions are added, click the _Grant admin consent_ button.
Note that it can take a while for the required permissions to be in effect, so
it's possible that you observe some permission errors when running {beatname_uc}
right away.

===== Alternative endpoints

This module supports custom endpoints for on-prem deployments as well as
alternative endpoints (GCC High endponts, U.S. DoD, European Union, etc). In
order to point the module to an alternative endpoint, you need to adjust the
`authentication_endpoint` and `resource` variables accordingly. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
    var.api:
      # default is https://login.microsoftonline.com/
      authentication_endpoint: https://login.microsoftonline.us/
      # default is https://manage.office.com
      resource: https://manage.office365.us
----

[float]
===== Configuration options

*`var.application_id`*::

The Application ID (also known as client ID) of the Azure application.

*`var.tenants`*::

A list of one or more tenant IDs and name pairs. Set the `id` field to the
tenant ID (also known as Directory ID). Set the name to the host name for the
tenant, that is, the Office 365 domain for your organization.

*`var.client_secret`*::

The client-secret (api_key) used to authenticate your Azure AD application. This
option cannot be specified at the same time as the `var.certificate` option.

*`var.certificate`*::

Path to the certificate file used for client authentication. This option cannot
be specified at the same time as the `var.client_secret` option.

*`var.key`*::

Path to the private key file used for client authentication.

*`var.key_passphrase`*::

The passphrase used to decrypt an encrypted key stored in the configured
`var.key` file. Only set this option when the key is encrypted.

*`var.content_type`*::

The list of content-types to subscribe to. By default, it subscribes to all
known content-types:
- Audit.AzureActiveDirectory
- Audit.Exchange
- Audit.SharePoint
- Audit.General
- DLP.All


[float]
===== Advanced configuration options

The following configuration options are only recomended in case of problems.
They must be nested under a single `var.api` key, like this:

[source,yaml]
----
    var.api:
      authentication_endpoint: https://login.microsoftonline.com/
      resource: https://manage.office.com
      max_retention: 168h
      poll_interval: 3m
      max_requests_per_minute: 2000
      max_query_size: 24h
----

*`var.api.authentication_endpoint`*::

The authentication endpoint used to authorize the Azure app. This is
`https://login.microsoftonline.com/` by default, and can be changed to access
alternative endpoints.

*`var.api.resource`*::

The API resource to retrieve information from. This is
`https://manage.office.com` by default, and can be changed to access alternative
endpoints.

*`var.api.max_retention`*::

The maximum data retention period to support. `168h` by default. {beatname_uc}
will fetch all retained data for a tenant when run for the first time. The
default is 7 days, which matches the standard period that Microsoft will keep the
logs before deleting them. Only increase it if your tenant has a longer retention period.

*`var.api.poll_interval`*::

The interval to wait before polling the API server for new events. Default `3m`.

*`var.api.max_requests_per_minute`*::

The maximum number of requests to perform per minute, for each tenant. The
default is `2000`, as this is the server-side limit per tenant.

*`var.api.max_query_size`*::

The maximum time window that API allows in a single query. Defaults to `24h`
to match Microsoft's documented limit.
