:modulename: zookeeper
:has-dashboards: false

== ZooKeeper module

The +{modulename}+ module collects and parses the logs created by https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Apache ZooKeeper]

include::../include/what-happens.asciidoc[]

include::../include/gs-link.asciidoc[]

[float]
=== Compatibility

The +{modulename}+ module was tested with logs from versions 3.7.0.

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

//set the fileset name used in the included example
:fileset_ex: audit

include::../include/config-option-intro.asciidoc[]

The following example shows how to set paths in the +modules.d/{modulename}.yml+
file to override the default paths for logs:

[source,yaml]
-----
- module: zookeeper
  audit:
    enabled: true
    var.paths:
      - "/path/to/logs/zookeeper_audit.log*"
  log:
    enabled: true
    var.paths:
      - "/path/to/logs/zookeeper.log*"
-----


To specify the same settings at the command line, you use:

[source,yaml]
-----
-M "zookeeper.audit.var.paths=[/path/to/logs/zookeeper_audit.log*]" -M "zookeeper.log.var.paths=[/path/to/logs/zookeeper.log*]"
-----

=== Audit logging

Audit logging is available since Zookeeper 3.6.0, but it is disabled by default. To enable it, you can add the following setting to the configuration file:
["source","sh"]
----------------------
audit.enable=true
----------------------
