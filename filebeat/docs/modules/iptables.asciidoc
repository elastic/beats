== Iptables module

This is a module for iptables and ip6tables logs. It parses logs received
over the network via syslog or from a file. Also, it understands the prefix added
by some Ubiquiti firewalls, which includes the rule set name, rule number and
the action performed on the traffic (allow/deny).

When you run the module, it performs a few tasks under the hood:

* Sets the default input to `syslog` and binds to `localhost` port `9001`
  (but donâ€™t worry, you can override the defaults).

* Uses ingest node to parse and process the log lines, shaping the data into
  a structure suitable for visualizing in Kibana.

* Deploys dashboards for visualizing the log data.

The module is by default configured to run via syslog on port 9001. However
it can also be configured to read from a file path. See the following example.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
-----
- module: iptables
  log:
    enabled: true
    var.paths: ["/var/log/iptables.log"]
    var.input: "file"
