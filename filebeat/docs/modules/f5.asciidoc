This is a module for F5 network device's logs. It includes the following
filesets for receiving logs over syslog or read from a file:

- `bigipapm` fileset: supports F5 Big-IP Access Policy Manager.
- `bigipafm` fileset: supports F5 Big-IP Advanced Firewall Manager.

=== Compatibility

TODO: document with what versions of the software is this tested

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

TODO: provide an example configuration

:fileset_ex: {fileset}

include::../include/config-option-intro.asciidoc[]

TODO: document the variables from each fileset. If you're describing a variable
that's common to other modules, you can reuse shared descriptions by including
the relevant file. For example:

which causes both ECS and custom fields under `rsa` to be added.

NOTE: This was converted from RSA NetWitness log parser XML "bigipafm" device revision 121.

*`var.input`*::

The input from which messages are read. One of `file`, `tcp` or `udp`.

*`var.syslog_host`*::

The address to listen to UDP or TCP based syslog traffic.
Defaults to `localhost`.
Set to `0.0.0.0` to bind to all available interfaces.

*`var.syslog_port`*::

The port to listen for syslog traffic. Defaults to `9528`

NOTE: Ports below 1024 require Filebeat to run as root.

*`var.tz_offset`*::

By default, datetimes in the logs will be interpreted as relative to
the timezone configured in the host where {beatname_uc} is running. If ingesting
logs from a host on a different timezone, use this field to set the timezone
offset so that datetimes are correctly parsed. Valid values are in the form
Â±HH:mm, for example, `-07:00` for `UTC-7`.

*`var.rsa_fields`*::

Flag to control the addition of non-ECS fields to the event. Defaults to true,
which causes both ECS and custom fields under `rsa` to be added.
