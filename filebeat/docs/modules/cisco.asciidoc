== Cisco module

This is a module for Cisco network device's logs. Currently supports the `asa`
fileset for Cisco ASA firewall logs received over syslog or read from a file.

Cisco ASA devices also support exporting flow records using NetFlow, which is
supported by the {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-netflow.html[netflow module] in
{beatname_uc}.

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

The module is by default configured to run via syslog on port 9001. However
it can also be configured to read from a file path. See the following example.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
-----
- module: cisco
  asa:
    enabled: true
    var.paths: ["/var/log/cisco-asa.log"]
    var.input: "file"
-----

:fileset_ex: asa

include::../include/config-option-intro.asciidoc[]

==== `asa` fileset settings

Example config:

[source,yaml]
----
  asa:
    var.log_level: 5
----

include::../include/var-paths.asciidoc[]

*`var.log_level`*::

An integer between 1 and 7 that allows to filter messages based on the
severity level. The different severity levels supported by the Cisco ASA are:

[width="30%",cols="^1,2",options="header"]
|===========================
| log_level | severity
|     1     | Alert
|     2     | Critical
|     3     | Error
|     4     | Warning
|     5     | Notification
|     6     | Informational
|     7     | Debugging
|===========================

A value of 7 (default) will not filter any messages. A lower value will drop
any messages with a severity level higher than the specified value. For
example, `var.log_level: 3` will allow messages of level 1 (Alert), 2 (Critical)
and 3 (Error). All other messages will be dropped.
