=== Compatibility

The +{modulename}+ module was tested with logs from `haproxy` running on AWS Linux as a gateway to a cluster of microservices.

The module was also tested with HAProxy 1.8, 1.9 and 2.0 running on a Debian.

This module is not available for Windows.

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

The module is by default configured to run via syslog on port 9001. However
it can also be configured to read from a file path. See the following example.

- module: haproxy
  log:
