=== Example dashboard

This module comes with a sample dashboard showing geolocation, distribution of requests between backends and frontends,
and status codes over time. For example:

[role="screenshot"]

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

The module is by default configured to run via syslog on port 9001. However
it can also be configured to read from a file path. See the following example.

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
-----
- module: haproxy
  log:
    enabled: true
    var.paths: ["/var/log/haproxy.log"]
    var.input: "file"
