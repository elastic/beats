== Azure module

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/integration-link.asciidoc[]

The azure module retrieves different types of log data from Azure.
There are several requirements before using the module since the logs will actually be read from azure event hubs.

   - the logs have to be exported first to the event hubs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create-kafka-enabled
   - to export activity logs to event hubs users can follow the steps here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log-export
   - to export audit and sign-in logs to event hubs users can follow the steps here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/tutorial-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub

The module contains the following filesets:

`activitylogs` ::
Will retrieve azure activity logs. Control-plane events on Azure Resource Manager resources. Activity logs provide insight into the operations that were performed on resources in your subscription. To learn more, refer to the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log[Azure Activity log] documentation.

`platformlogs` ::
Will retrieve azure platform logs. Platform logs provide detailed diagnostic and auditing information for Azure resources and the Azure platform they depend on. To learn more, refer to the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview[Azure platform logs] documentation.

`signinlogs` ::
Will retrieve azure Active Directory sign-in logs. The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities. To learn more, refer to the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins[Azure sign-in logs] documentation.

`auditlogs` ::
Will retrieve azure Active Directory audit logs. The audit logs provide traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies. To learn more, refer to the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs[Azure audit logs] documentation.

=== Module configuration

[source,yaml]
----
- module: azure
  activitylogs:
    enabled: true
    var:
      eventhub: "insights-operational-logs"
      consumer_group: "$Default"
      connection_string: ""
      storage_account: ""
      storage_account_key: ""
      resource_manager_endpoint: ""

    enabled: false
    var:
      eventhub: ""
      consumer_group: "$Default"
      connection_string: ""
      storage_account: ""
      storage_account_key: ""
      resource_manager_endpoint: ""

  auditlogs:

    var:
      eventhub: "insights-logs-auditlogs"
      consumer_group: "$Default"
      connection_string: ""
      storage_account: ""
      storage_account_key: ""
      resource_manager_endpoint: ""

  signinlogs:
    enabled: false
    var:
      eventhub: "insights-logs-signinlogs"
      consumer_group: "$Default"
      connection_string: ""
      storage_account: ""
      storage_account_key: ""
      resource_manager_endpoint: ""

----


`eventhub` ::
  _string_
Is the fully managed, real-time data ingestion service.
Default value of `insights-operational-logs` for activitylogs, `insights-logs-auditlogs` for auditlogs, and `insights-logs-signinlogs` for signinlogs. It is recommended to use a separate eventhub for each log type as the field mappings of each log type are different.

`consumer_group` ::
_string_
 The publish/subscribe mechanism of Event Hubs is enabled through consumer groups. A consumer group is a view (state, position, or offset) of an entire event hub. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream independently at their own pace and with their own offsets.
Default value: `$Default`

`connection_string` ::
_string_
The connection string required to communicate with Event Hubs, steps here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string.

A Blob Storage account is required in order to store/retrieve/update the offset or state of the eventhub messages. This means that after stopping the filebeat azure module it can start back up at the spot that it stopped processing messages.


`storage_account` ::
_string_
The name of the storage account the state/offsets will be stored and updated.

`storage_account_key` ::
_string_
The storage account key, this key will be used to authorize access to data in your storage account.

`resource_manager_endpoint` ::
_string_
Optional, by default we are using the azure public environment, to override, users can provide a specific resource manager endpoint in order to use a different azure environment.
Ex:
https://management.chinacloudapi.cn/ for azure ChinaCloud
https://management.microsoftazure.de/ for azure GermanCloud
https://management.azure.com/ for azure PublicCloud
https://management.usgovcloudapi.net/ for azure USGovernmentCloud
Users can also use this in case of a Hybrid Cloud model, where one may define their own endpoints.
