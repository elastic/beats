== PostgreSQL module

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/integration-link.asciidoc[]

The +{modulename}+ module  collects and parses logs created by
https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL].

include::../include/what-happens.asciidoc[]

include::../include/gs-link.asciidoc[]

=== Compatibility

This module comes in two flavours: a parser of log files based on Linux distribution
defaults, and a CSV log parser, that you need to enable in database configuration.

The +{modulename}+ module using `.log` was tested with logs from versions 9.5 on Ubuntu,
 9.6 on Debian, and finally 10.11, 11.4 and 12.2 on Arch Linux 9.3.

The +{modulename}+ module using `.csv` was tested using versions 11 and 13 (distro is not relevant here).

=== Supported log formats

This module can collect any logs from PostgreSQL servers, but to be able to
better analyze their contents and extract more information, they should be
formatted in a determined way.

There are some settings to take into account for the log format.

Log lines should be preffixed with the timestamp in milliseconds, the process
id, the user id and the database name. This uses to be the default in most
distributions, and is translated to this setting in the configuration file:

["source","sh"]
----------------------------
log_line_prefix = '%m [%p] %q%u@%d '
----------------------------

PostgreSQL server can be configured to log statements and their durations and
this module is able to collect this information. To be able to correlate each
duration with their statements, they must be logged in the same line. This
happens when the following options are used:

["source","sh"]
----------------------------
log_duration = 'on'
log_statement = 'none'
log_min_duration_statement = 0
----------------------------

Setting a zero value in `log_min_duration_statement` will log all statements
executed by a client. You probably want to configure it to a higher value, so it
logs only slower statements. This value is configured in milliseconds.

When using `log_statement` and `log_duration` together, statements and durations
are logged in different lines, and {beatname_uc} is not able to correlate both
values, for this reason it is recommended to disable `log_statement`.

NOTE: The PostgreSQL module of Metricbeat is also able to collect information
about all statements executed in the server. You may chose which one is better
for your needings. An important difference is that the Metricbeat module
collects aggregated information when the statement is executed several times,
but cannot know when each statement was executed. This information can be
obtained from logs.

Other logging options that you may consider to enable are the following ones:

["source","sh"]
----------------------------
log_checkpoints = 'on';
log_connections = 'on';
log_disconnections = 'on';
log_lock_waits = 'on';
----------------------------

Both `log_connections` and `log_disconnections` can cause a lot of events if you
don't have persistent connections, so enable with care.

=== Using CSV logs

Since the PostgreSQL CSV log file is a well-defined format,
there is almost no configuration to be done in {beatname_uc}, just the filepath.

On the other hand, it's necessary to configure postgresql to emit `.csv` logs.
The recommended parameters are:

["source","sh"]
----------------------------
logging_collector = 'on';
log_destination = 'csvlog';
----------------------------


include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

The following example shows how to set paths in the +modules.d/{modulename}.yml+
file to override the default paths for PostgreSQL logs:


["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
-----
- module: postgresql
  log:
    enabled: true
    var.paths: ["/path/to/log/postgres/*.log*"]
-----


To specify the same settings at the command line, you use:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
-----
-M "postgresql.log.var.paths=[/path/to/log/postgres/*.log*]"
-----


//set the fileset name used in the included example
:fileset_ex: log

=== Example dashboards

This module comes with two sample dashboards.

The first dashboard is for regular logs.

The second one shows the slowlogs of PostgreSQL. If `log_min_duration_statement`
is not used, this dashboard will show incomplete or no data.
