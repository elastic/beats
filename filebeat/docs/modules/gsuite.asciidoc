=== Configure the module

In order for Filebeat to ingest data from the Google Reports API you must:

- Have an *administrator account*.
- https://support.google.com/gsuitemigrate/answer/9222993?hl=en[Set up a ServiceAccount] using the administrator account.
- https://support.google.com/gsuitemigrate/answer/9222865?hl=en[Set up access to the Admin SDK API] for the ServiceAccount.
- https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/delegation[Enable Domain-Wide Delegation] for your ServiceAccount.

This module will make use of the following *oauth2 scope*:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly`

Once you have downloaded your service account credentials as a JSON file,
you can set up your module:

===== Configuration options

[source,yaml]

- module: gsuite
  saml:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  user_accounts:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  login:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  admin:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  drive:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  groups:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
----

Every fileset has the following configuration options:

*`var.jwt_file`*::

Specifies the path to the JWT credentials file.

*`var.delegated_account`*::

Email of the admin user used to access the API.

*`var.http_client_timeout`*::

Duration of the time limit on HTTP requests made by the module. Defaults to
`60s`.

*`var.interval`*::

Duration between requests to the API. Defaults to `2h`.

NOTE: GSuite defaults to a 2 hour polling interval because Google reports can go from
some minutes up to 3 days of delay. For more details on this, you can read more https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566[here].

*`var.user_key`*::

Specifies the user key to fetch reports from. Defaults to `all`.

*`var.initial_interval`*::

It will poll events up to this time period when the module starts. This is to prevent polling too many or repeated events on module restarts. Defaults to `24h`.
