== Oracle module
beta[]

This is a module for ingesting Audit Trail logs from Oracle Databases.

The module expects an *.aud audit file that is generated from Oracle Databases by default. If this has been disabled then please see the https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dbseg/introduction-to-auditing.html#GUID-8D96829C-9151-4FA4-BED9-831D088F12FF[Oracle Database Audit Trail Documentation].

=== Compatibility

This module has been tested with Oracle Database 19c, and should work for 18c as well though it has not been tested.

==== `database_audit` fileset settings

Example config:

[source,yaml]
----
- module: oracle
  database_audit:
    var.input: file
    var.paths: /home/user/oracleauditlogs/*/*.aud
----

include::../include/var-paths.asciidoc[]

*`var.tags`*::

A list of tags to include in events. Including `forwarded` indicates that the
events did not originate on this host and causes `host.name` to not be added to
events. Defaults to `[oracle-database-audit]`.
