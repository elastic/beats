== AWS module

beta[]

This is a module for aws logs. It uses filebeat s3 input to get log files from
AWS S3 buckets with SQS notification. This module supports reading s3 server
access logs with `s3access` fileset, ELB access logs with `elb` fileset, VPC
flow logs with `vpc` fileset, and CloudTrail logs with `cloudtrail` fileset.

Access logs contain detailed information about the requests made to these
services. VPC flow logs captures information about the IP traffic going to and
from network interfaces in AWS VPC.  CloudTrail logs contain events
that represent actions taken by a user, role or AWS service.

*`var.queue_url`*::

AWS SQS queue url.

*`var.credential_profile_name`*::

=== CloudTrail fileset

The `cloudtrail` fileset does not read the CloudTrail Digest files
that are delivered to the S3 bucket when Log File Integrity is turned
on, it only reads the CloudTrail logs.
