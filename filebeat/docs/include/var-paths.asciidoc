*`var.paths`*::

An array of glob-based paths that specify where to look for the log files. All
patterns supported by https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Glob[Go Glob]
are also supported here. For example, you can use wildcards to fetch all files
from a predefined level of subdirectories: `/path/to/log/*/*.log`. This
fetches all `.log` files from the subfolders of `/path/to/log`. It does not
fetch log files from the `/path/to/log` folder itself. If this setting is left
empty, {beatname_uc} will choose log paths based on your operating system.
