==== Timezone support

This module parses logs that don't contain timezone information. For these logs,
Filebeat reads the local timezone and uses it when parsing to convert the
timestamp to UTC. The timezone to be used for parsing is included in the event
in the `event.timezone` field.

To disable this conversion, the `event.timezone` field can be removed with
the `drop_fields` processor.

If logs are originated from systems or applications with a different timezone to
the local one, the `event.timezone` field can be overwritten with the original
timezone using the `add_fields` processor.

See <<filtering-and-enhancing-data>> for information about specifying
processors in your config.
