*`var.use_journald`*::

A boolean that when set to `true` will read logs from Journald. When
Journald is used all events contain the tag `journald`

*`var.use_logs`*::

A boolean that when set to `true` will read logs from the log files
defined by `vars.paths`.

If neither `var.use_journald` nor `var.use_logs` are set (or both are
`false`) {beatname_uc} will auto-detect the source for the logs.

If both `var.use_journald` and `var.use_logs` are set to `true` then
Journald will be used.
