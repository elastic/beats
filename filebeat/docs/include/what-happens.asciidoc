When you run the module, it performs a few tasks under the hood:

* Sets the default paths to the log files (but don't worry, you can override the
defaults)

* Makes sure each multiline log event gets sent as a single event

* Uses ingest node to parse and process the log lines, shaping the data into a structure suitable
for visualizing in Kibana

* Deploys dashboards for visualizing the log data
