[[configuration-filebeat-options]]
=== Filebeat Prospectors

The `filebeat` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file specifies a list of `prospectors` that Filebeat
uses to locate and process log files. Each prospector item begins with a dash (-)
and specifies prospector-specific configuration options, including
the list of paths that are crawled to locate log files.

Here is a sample configuration:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.prospectors:
- type: log
  paths:
    - /var/log/apache/httpd-*.log

- type: log
  paths:
    - /var/log/messages
    - /var/log/*.log
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Options

===== type

One of the following input types:

    * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
    * stdin: Reads the standard in
    * redis: Reads slow log entries from redis (experimental)

The value that you specify here is used as the `type` for each event published to Logstash and Elasticsearch.

[[prospector-paths]]
===== paths

A list of glob-based paths that should be crawled and fetched. All patterns
supported by https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Glob[Golang Glob] are also
supported here. For example, to fetch all files from a predefined level of
subdirectories, the following pattern can be used: `/var/log/*/*.log`. This
fetches all `.log` files from the subfolders of `/var/log`. It does not
fetch log files from the `/var/log` folder itself.
It is possible to recursively fetch all files in all subdirectories of a directory
using the optional <<recursive_glob>> settings.

Filebeat starts a harvester for each file that it finds under the specified
paths. You can specify one path per line. Each line begins with a dash (-).

[[recursive_glob]]
===== recursive_glob

*`enabled`*:: Enable expanding `**` into recursive glob patterns. With this feature enabled,
the rightmost `**` in each path is expanded into a fixed
number of glob patterns. For example: `/foo/**` expands to `/foo`, `/foo/*`,
`/foo/*/*`, and so on. The feature is disabled by default, and if enabled it expands a single `**`
into a 8-level deep `*` pattern.

===== encoding

The file encoding to use for reading files that contain international characters.
See the encoding names http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding/[recommended by the W3C for use in HTML5].

Here are some sample encodings from W3C recommendation:

    * plain, latin1, utf-8, utf-16be-bom, utf-16be, utf-16le, big5, gb18030, gbk, hz-gb-2312,
    * euc-kr, euc-jp, iso-2022-jp, shift-jis, and so on

The `plain` encoding is special, because it does not validate or transform any input.

[[exclude-lines]]
===== exclude_lines

A list of regular expressions to match the lines that you want Filebeat to exclude. Filebeat drops any lines that match a regular expression in the list. By default, no lines are dropped.

If <<multiline>> is also specified, each multiline message is combined into a single line before the lines are filtered by `exclude_lines`.

The following example configures Filebeat to drop any lines that start with "DBG".

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.prospectors:
- paths:
    - /var/log/myapp/*.log
  exclude_lines: ['^DBG']
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See <<regexp-support>> for a list of supported regexp patterns.

[[include-lines]]
===== include_lines

A list of regular expressions to match the lines that you want Filebeat to include. Filebeat exports only the lines that match a regular expression in the list. By default, all lines are exported.

If <<multiline>> is also specified, each multiline message is combined into a single line before the lines are filtered by `include_lines`.

The following example configures Filebeat to export any lines that start with "ERR" or "WARN":

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.prospectors:
- paths:
    - /var/log/myapp/*.log
  include_lines: ['^ERR', '^WARN']
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If both `include_lines` and `exclude_lines` are defined, Filebeat executes `include_lines` first and then executes `exclude_lines`.
The order in which the two options are defined doesn't matter. The `include_lines` option will always be executed
before the `exclude_lines` option, even if `exclude_lines` appears before `include_lines` in the config file.

The following example exports all Apache log lines except the debugging messages (DBGs):

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 include_lines: ['apache']
 exclude_lines: ['^DBG']
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See <<regexp-support>> for a list of supported regexp patterns.

[[exclude-files]]
===== exclude_files

A list of regular expressions to match the files that you want Filebeat to ignore. By default no files are excluded.

The following example configures Filebeat to ignore all the files that have a `gz` extension:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  exclude_files: ['\.gz$']
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See <<regexp-support>> for a list of supported regexp patterns.

===== tags

A list of tags that the Beat includes in the `tags` field of each published
event. Tags make it easy to select specific events in Kibana or apply
conditional filtering in Logstash. These tags will be appended to the list of
tags specified in the general configuration.

Example:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.prospectors:
- paths: ["/var/log/app/*.json"]
  tags: ["json"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[configuration-fields]]
===== fields

Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
output. For example, you might add fields that you can use for filtering log
data. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
combination of these. By default, the fields that you specify here will be
grouped under a `fields` sub-dictionary in the output document. To store the
custom fields as top-level fields, set the `fields_under_root` option to true.
If a duplicate field is declared in the general configuration, then its value
will be overwritten by the value declared here.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.prospectors:
- paths: ["/var/log/app/*.log"]
  fields:
    app_id: query_engine_12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[fields-under-root]]
===== fields_under_root

If this option is set to true, the custom <<configuration-fields>> are stored as
top-level fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a
`fields` sub-dictionary. If the custom field names conflict with other field
names added by Filebeat, then the custom fields overwrite the other fields.

[[ignore-older]]
===== ignore_older

If this option is enabled, Filebeat ignores any files that were modified before the specified timespan. Configuring `ignore_older` can be especially useful if you keep log files for a long time. For example, if you want to start Filebeat, but only want to send the newest files and files from last week, you can configure this option.

You can use time strings like 2h (2 hours) and 5m (5 minutes). The default is 0, which disables the setting.
Commenting out the config has the same effect as setting it to 0.

IMPORTANT: You must set `ignore_older` to be greater than `close_inactive`.

The files affected by this setting fall into two categories:

* Files that were never harvested
* Files that were harvested but weren't updated for longer than `ignore_older`

For files which were never seen before, the offset state is set to the end of the file. If a state already exist, the offset is not changed. In case a file is updated again later, reading continues at the set offset position.

The `ignore_older` setting relies on the modification time of the file to determine if a file is ignored. If the modification time of the file is not updated when lines are written to a file (which can happen on Windows), the `ignore_older` setting may cause Filebeat to ignore files even though content was added at a later time.

To remove the state of previously harvested files from the registry file, use the `clean_inactive` configuration option.

Before a file can be ignored by the prospector, it must be closed. To ensure a file is no longer being harvested when it is ignored, you must set `ignore_older` to a longer duration than `close_inactive`.

If a file that's currently being harvested falls under `ignore_older`, the harvester will first finish reading the file and close it after `close_inactive` is reached. Then, after that, the file will be ignored.

[[close-options]]
===== close_*

The `close_*` configuration options are used to close the harvester after a certain criteria or time. Closing the harvester means closing the file handler. If a file is updated after the harvester is closed, the file will be picked up again after `scan_frequency` has elapsed. However, if the file is moved or deleted while the harvester is closed, Filebeat will not be able to pick up the file again, and any data that the harvester hasn't read will be lost.


[[close-inactive]]
===== close_inactive

When this option is enabled, Filebeat closes the file handle if a file has not been harvested for the specified duration. The counter for the defined period starts when the last log line was read by the harvester. It is not based on the modification time of the file. If the closed file changes again, a new harvester is started and the latest changes will be picked up after `scan_frequency` has elapsed.

We recommended that you set `close_inactive` to a value that is larger than the least frequent updates to your log files. For example, if your log files get updated every few seconds, you can safely set `close_inactive` to `1m`. If there are log files with very different update rates, you can use multiple prospector configurations with different values.

Setting `close_inactive` to a lower value means that file handles are closed sooner. However this has the side effect that new log lines are not sent in near real time if the harvester is closed.

The timestamp for closing a file does not depend on the modification time of the file. Instead, Filebeat uses an internal timestamp that reflects when the file was last harvested. For example, if `close_inactive` is set to 5 minutes, the countdown for the 5 minutes starts after the harvester reads the last line of the file.

You can use time strings like 2h (2 hours) and 5m (5 minutes). The default is 5m.

[[close-renamed]]
===== close_renamed

WARNING: Only use this option if you understand that data loss is a potential side effect.

When this option is enabled, Filebeat closes the file handler when a file is renamed. This happens, for example, when rotating files. By default, the harvester stays open and keeps reading the file because the file handler does not depend on the file name. If the `close_renamed` option is enabled and the file is renamed or moved in such a way that it's no longer matched by the file patterns specified for the prospector, the file will not be picked up again. Filebeat will not finish reading the file.

WINDOWS: If your Windows log rotation system shows errors because it can't rotate the files, you should enable this option.

[[close-removed]]
===== close_removed

When this option is enabled, Filebeat closes the harvester when a file is removed. Normally a file should only be removed after it's inactive for the duration specified by `close_inactive`. However, if a file is removed early and you don't enable `close_removed`, Filebeat keeps the file open to make sure the harvester has completed. If this setting results in files that are not completely read because they are removed from disk too early, disable this option.

This option is enabled by default. If you disable this option, you must also disable `clean_removed`.

WINDOWS:  If your Windows log rotation system shows errors because it can't rotate files, make sure this option is enabled.

[[close-eof]]
===== close_eof

WARNING: Only use this option if you understand that data loss is a potential side effect.

When this option is enabled, Filebeat closes a file as soon as the end of a file is reached. This is useful when your files are only written once and not updated from time to time. For example, this happens when you are writing every single log event to a new file. This option is disabled by default.

[[close-timeout]]
===== close_timeout

WARNING: Only use this option if you understand that data loss is a potential side effect. Another side effect is that multiline events might not be completely sent before the timeout expires.

When this option is enabled, Filebeat gives every harvester a predefined lifetime. Regardless of where the reader is in the file, reading will stop after the `close_timeout` period has elapsed. This option can be useful for older log files when you want to spend only a predefined amount of time on the files.  While `close_timeout` will close the file after the predefined timeout, if the file is still being updated, the prospector will start a new harvester again per the defined `scan_frequency`. And the close_timeout for this harvester will start again with the countdown for the timeout.

If you set `close_timeout` to equal `ignore_older`, the file will not be picked up if it's modified while the harvester is closed. This combination of settings normally leads to data loss, and the complete file is not sent.

When you use `close_timeout` for logs that contain multiline events, the harvester might stop in the middle of a multiline event, which means that only parts of the event will be sent. If the harvester is started again and the file still exists, only the second part of the event will be sent.

The `close_timeout` setting won't apply if your output is stalled and no further events can be sent. At least one event must be sent after `close_timeout` elapses so the harvester can be closed after sending the event.

This option is set to 0 by default which means it is disabled.


[[clean-options]]
===== clean_*

The `clean_*` options are used to clean up the state entries in the registry file. These settings help to reduce the size of the registry file and can prevent a potential <<inode-reuse-issue,inode reuse issue>>.

[[clean-inactive]]
===== clean_inactive

WARNING: Only use this option if you understand that data loss is a potential side effect.

When this option is enabled, Filebeat removes the state of a file after the specified period of inactivity has elapsed. The  state can only be removed if the file is already ignored by Filebeat (the file is older than `ignore_older`). The `clean_inactive` setting must be greater than `ignore_older + scan_frequency` to make sure that no states are removed while a file is still being harvested. Otherwise, the setting could result in Filebeat resending the full content constantly because  `clean_inactive` removes state for files that are still detected by the prospector. If a file is updated or appears again, the file is read from the beginning.

The `clean_inactive` configuration option is useful to reduce the size of the registry file, especially if a large amount of new files are generated every day.

This config option is also useful to prevent Filebeat problems resulting from inode reuse on Linux. For more information, see <<inode-reuse-issue>>.

NOTE: Every time a file is renamed, the file state is updated and the counter for `clean_inactive` starts at 0 again.

[[clean-removed]]
===== clean_removed

When this option is enabled, Filebeat cleans files from the registry if they cannot be found on disk anymore under the last known name. This means also files which were renamed after the harvester was finished will be removed. This option is enabled by default.

If a shared drive disappears for a short period and appears again, all files will be read again from the beginning because the states were removed from the registry file. In such cases, we recommend that you disable the `clean_removed` option.

You must disable this option if you also disable `close_removed`.

[[scan-frequency]]
===== scan_frequency

How often the prospector checks for new files in the paths that are specified
for harvesting. For example, if you specify a glob like `/var/log/*`, the
directory is scanned for files using the frequency specified by
`scan_frequency`. Specify 1s to scan the directory as frequently as possible
without causing Filebeat to scan too frequently. We do not recommend to set this value `<1s`.

If you require log lines to be sent in near real time do not use a very low `scan_frequency` but adjust `close_inactive` so the file handler stays open and constantly polls your files.

The default setting is 10s.


[[scan-sort]]
===== scan.sort

[]experimental

 If you specify a value other than the empty string for this setting you can determine whether to use ascending or descending order using `scan.order`. Possible values are `modtime` and `filename`. To sort by file modification time, use `modtime`, otherwise use `filename`. Leave this option empty to disable it.

If you specify a value for this setting, you can use `scan.order` to configure whether files are scanned in ascending or descending order.

The default setting is disabled.


[[scan-order]]
===== scan.order

[]experimental

Specifies whether to use ascending or descending order when `scan.sort` is set to a value other than none. Possible values are `asc` or `desc`.

The default setting is `asc`.


===== harvester_buffer_size

The size in bytes of the buffer that each harvester uses when fetching a file. The default is 16384.

===== max_bytes

The maximum number of bytes that a single log message can have. All bytes after `max_bytes` are discarded and not sent.
This setting is especially useful for multiline log messages, which can get large. The default is 10MB (10485760).

[[config-json]]
===== json
These options make it possible for Filebeat to decode logs structured as JSON messages. Filebeat
processes the logs line by line, so the JSON decoding only works if there is one JSON object per
line.

The decoding happens before line filtering and multiline. You can combine JSON decoding with filtering
and multiline if you set the `message_key` option. This can be helpful in situations where the application
logs are wrapped in JSON objects, like it happens for example with Docker.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
json.keys_under_root: true
json.add_error_key: true
json.message_key: log
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*`keys_under_root`*:: By default, the decoded JSON is placed under a "json" key in the output document.
If you enable this setting, the keys are copied top level in the output document. The default is false.

*`overwrite_keys`*:: If `keys_under_root` and this setting are enabled, then the values from the decoded
JSON object overwrite the fields that Filebeat normally adds (type, source, offset, etc.) in case of conflicts.

*`add_error_key`*:: If this setting is enabled, Filebeat adds a "error.message" and "error.type: json" key in case of JSON
unmarshalling errors or when a `message_key` is defined in the configuration but cannot be used.

*`message_key`*:: An optional configuration setting that specifies a JSON key on
which to apply the line filtering and multiline settings. If specified the
key must be at the top level in the JSON object and the value associated with
the key must be a string, otherwise no filtering or multiline aggregation will
occur.


[[multiline]]
===== multiline

IMPORTANT: If you are sending multiline events to Logstash, use the options described here to handle multiline events
before sending the event data to Logstash. Trying to implement multiline event handling in Logstash (for example, by
using the Logstash multiline codec) may result in the mixing of streams and corrupted data.

Options that control how Filebeat deals with log messages that span multiple lines. Multiline messages are common in files that contain Java stack traces.

The following example shows how to configure Filebeat to handle a multiline message where the first line of the message begins with a bracket (`[`).

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
multiline.pattern: '^\['
multiline.negate: true
multiline.match: after

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filebeat takes all the lines that do not start with `[` and combines them with the previous line that does. For example, you could use this configuration to join the following lines of a multiline message into a single event:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[beat-logstash-some-name-832-2015.11.28] IndexNotFoundException[no such index]
    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.IndexNameExpressionResolver$WildcardExpressionResolver.resolve(IndexNameExpressionResolver.java:566)
    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.IndexNameExpressionResolver.concreteIndices(IndexNameExpressionResolver.java:133)
    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.IndexNameExpressionResolver.concreteIndices(IndexNameExpressionResolver.java:77)
    at org.elasticsearch.action.admin.indices.delete.TransportDeleteIndexAction.checkBlock(TransportDeleteIndexAction.java:75)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See <<multiline-examples>> for more configuration examples.

You specify the following settings under `multiline` to control how Filebeat combines the lines in the message:

*`pattern`*:: Specifies the regular expression pattern to match. Note that the regexp patterns supported by Filebeat differ
somewhat from the patterns supported by Logstash. See <<regexp-support>> for a list of supported regexp patterns.

*`negate`*:: Defines whether the pattern is negated. The default is `false`.

*`match`*:: Specifies how Filebeat combines matching lines into an event. The settings are `after` or `before`. The behavior of these settings depends on what you specify for `negate`:
+
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Setting for `negate` | Setting for `match` | Result | Example `pattern: ^b`
|`false`              | `after`             | Consecutive lines that match the pattern are appended to the previous line that doesn't match. | image:./images/false-after-multi.png[Lines a b b c b b become "abb" and "cbb"]
|`false`              | `before`            | Consecutive lines that match the pattern are prepended to the next line that doesn't match. | image:./images/false-before-multi.png[Lines b b a b b c become "bba" and "bbc"]
|`true`               | `after`             | Consecutive lines that don't match the pattern are appended to the previous line that does match. | image:./images/true-after-multi.png[Lines b a c b d e become "bac" and "bde"]
|`true`               | `before`            | Consecutive lines that don't match the pattern are prepended to the next line that does match. | image:./images/true-before-multi.png[Lines a c b d e b become "acb" and "deb"]
|=======================
+
NOTE: The `after` setting is equivalent to `previous` in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-codecs-multiline.html[Logstash], and `before` is equivalent to `next`.

*`max_lines`*:: The maximum number of lines that can be combined into one event. If
the multiline message contains more than `max_lines`, any additional
lines are discarded. The default is 500.

*`timeout`*:: After the specified timeout, Filebeat sends the multiline event even if no new pattern is found to start a new event. The default is 5s.

===== tail_files

If this option is set to true, Filebeat starts reading new files at the end of each file instead of the beginning. When this option is used in combination with log rotation, it's possible that the first log entries in a new file might be skipped. The default setting is false.

This option applies to files that Filebeat has not already processed. If you ran Filebeat previously and the state of the file was already persisted, `tail_files` will not apply. Harvesting will continue at the previous offset. To apply `tail_files` to all files, you must stop Filebeat and remove the registry file. Be aware that doing this removes ALL previous states.

NOTE: You can use this setting to avoid indexing old log lines when you run Filebeat on a set of log files for the first time. After the first run, we recommend disabling this option, or you risk losing lines during file rotation.

===== pipeline

The Ingest Node pipeline ID to set for the events generated by this prospector.

NOTE: The pipeline ID can also be configured in the Elasticsearch output, but this
  option usually results in simpler configuration files. If the pipeline is configured both
  in the prospector and in the output, the option from the prospector is the one used.

===== symlinks

The `symlinks` option allows Filebeat to harvest symlinks in addition to regular files. When harvesting symlinks, Filebeat opens and reads the original file even though it reports the path of the symlink.

When you configure a symlink for harvesting, make sure the original path is excluded. If a single prospector is configured to harvest both the symlink and the original file, the prospector will detect the problem and only process the first file it finds. However, if two different prospectors are configured (one to read the symlink and the other the original path), both paths will be harvested, causing Filebeat to send duplicate data and the prospectors to overwrite each other's state.

The `symlinks` option can be useful if symlinks to the log files have additional metadata in the file name, and you want to process the metadata in Logstash. This is, for example, the case for Kubernetes log files.

Because this option may lead to data loss, it is disabled by default.

===== backoff

The backoff options specify how aggressively Filebeat crawls open files for updates.
You can use the default values in most cases.

The `backoff` option defines how long Filebeat
waits before checking a file again after EOF is reached. The default is 1s, which means
the file is checked every second if new lines were added. This enables near real-time crawling. Every time a new line appears in the file, the `backoff` value is reset to the initial
value. The default is 1s.

===== max_backoff

The maximum time for Filebeat to wait before checking a file again after EOF is
reached. After having backed off multiple times from checking the file, the wait time
will never exceed `max_backoff` regardless of what is specified for  `backoff_factor`.
Because it takes a maximum of 10s to read a new line, specifying 10s for `max_backoff` means that, at the worst, a new line could be added to the log file if Filebeat has
backed off multiple times. The default is 10s.

Requirement: max_backoff should always be set to `max_backoff <= scan_frequency`. In case `max_backoff` should be bigger, it is recommended to close the file handler instead let the prospector pick up the file again.

===== backoff_factor

This option specifies how fast the waiting time is increased. The bigger the
backoff factor, the faster the `max_backoff` value is reached. The backoff factor
increments exponentially. The minimum value allowed is 1. If this value is set to 1,
the backoff algorithm is disabled, and the `backoff` value is used for waiting for new
lines. The `backoff` value will be multiplied each time with the `backoff_factor` until
`max_backoff` is reached. The default is 2.

[[harvester-limit]]
===== harvester_limit

The `harvester_limit` option limits the number of harvesters that are started in parallel for one prospector. This directly relates
to the maximum number of file handlers that are opened. The default for `harvester_limit` is 0, which means there is no limit. This
configuration is useful if the number of files to be harvested exceeds the open file handler limit of the operating system.

Setting a limit on the number of harvesters means that potentially not all files are opened in parallel. Therefore we recommended that you use
this option in combination with the `close_*` options to make sure harvesters are stopped more often so that new files can be
picked up.

Currently if a new harvester can be started again, the harvester is picked randomly. This means it's possible that the harvester for a file that was just closed and then updated again might be started instead of the harvester for a file that hasn't been harvested for a longer period of time.

This configuration option applies per prospector. You can use this option to indirectly set higher priorities on certain prospectors
by assigning a higher limit of harvesters.

===== enabled

The `enabled` option can be used with each prospector to define if a prospector is enabled or not. By default, enabled is set to true.

[[configuration-global-options]]
=== Filebeat Global

You can specify configuration options in the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file to control Filebeat behavior at a global level.

==== Options

===== spool_size

The event count spool threshold. This setting forces a network flush if the number of events in the spooler exceeds
the specified value.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.spool_size: 2048
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See <<load-balancing>> for more information about how this setting affects load balancing.

===== publish_async

experimental[]
deprecated[5.3.0]

If enabled, the publisher pipeline in Filebeat operates in async mode preparing
a new batch of lines while waiting for ACK. This option can improve load-balancing
throughput at the cost of increased memory usage. The default value is false.

See <<load-balancing>> for more information about how this setting affects load balancing.

===== idle_timeout

A duration string that specifies how often the spooler is flushed. After the
`idle_timeout` is reached, the spooler is flushed even if the `spool_size` has not been reached.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.idle_timeout: 5s
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===== registry_file

The name of the registry file. If a relative path is used, it is considered relative to the
data path. See the <<directory-layout>> section for details. The default is `${path.data}/registry`.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.registry_file: registry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is not possible to use a symlink as registry file.

NOTE: The registry file is only updated when new events are flushed and not on a predefined period.
That means in case there are some states where the TTL expired, these are only removed when new event are processed.


===== config_dir

The full path to the directory that contains additional prospector configuration files.
Each configuration file must end with `.yml`. Each config file must also specify the full Filebeat
config hierarchy even though only the prospector part of the file is processed. All global
options, such as `spool_size`, are ignored.

The `config_dir` option MUST point to a directory other than the directory where the main Filebeat config file resides.

If the specified path is not absolute, it is considered relative to the configuration path. See the
<<directory-layout>> section for details.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.config_dir: path/to/configs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[shutdown-timeout]]
===== shutdown_timeout

How long Filebeat waits on shutdown for the publisher to finish sending events
before Filebeat shuts down.

By default, this option is disabled, and Filebeat does not wait for the
publisher to finish sending events before shutting down. This means that any
events sent to the output, but not acknowledged before Filebeat shuts down,
are sent again when you restart Filebeat. For more details about how this
works, see <<at-least-once-delivery>>.

You can configure the `shutdown_timeout` option to specify the maximum amount
of time that Filebeat waits for the publisher to finish sending events before
shutting down. If all events are acknowledged before `shutdown_timeout` is
reached, Filebeat will shut down.

There is no recommended setting for this option because determining the correct
value for `shutdown_timeout` depends heavily on the environment in which
Filebeat is running and the current state of the output.

Example configuration:
