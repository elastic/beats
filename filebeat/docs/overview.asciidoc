{beatname_uc} is a lightweight shipper for forwarding and centralizing log data.
Installed as an agent on your servers, {beatname_uc} monitors the log
files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them
to either to https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] or
https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash[Logstash] for indexing.

Here's how {beatname_uc} works: When you start {beatname_uc}, it starts one or
more inputs that look in the locations you've specified for log data. For
each log that {beatname_uc} locates, {beatname_uc} starts a harvester. Each
harvester reads a single log for new content and sends the new log data to
libbeat, which aggregates the events and sends the aggregated data to the output
that you've configured for {beatname_uc}.

{beatname_uc} is a https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[Beat], and it is based on
the libbeat framework. General information about libbeat and setting up
Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana are covered in the
{libbeat}/index.html[Beats Platform Reference].
