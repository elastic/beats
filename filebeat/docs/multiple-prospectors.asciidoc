=== Specify multiple prospectors

When you need to collect lines from multiple files, you can simply configure a single prospector and specify multiple
paths to start a harvester for each file. However, if you want to apply additional prospector-specific
<<configuration-filebeat-options,configuration settings>> (such as `fields`, `include_lines`, `exclude_lines`, `multiline`, and so on)
to the lines harvested from specific files, you need to define multiple prospectors in the Filebeat config file.

Within the config file, you can specify multiple prospectors, and each prospector can define multiple paths to crawl, as
shown in the following example.

NOTE: Make sure a file is not defined more than once across all prospectors because this can lead
to unexpected behaviour.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.prospectors:
- type: log
  paths:
    - /var/log/system.log
    - /var/log/wifi.log
- type: log
  paths:
    - "/var/log/apache2/*"
  fields:
    apache: true
  fields_under_root: true
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The config file in the example starts two prospectors (the list of prospectors is a http://yaml.org/[YAML]
array, so each prospector begins with a `-`). The first prospector has two harvesters,
one harvesting the `system.log` file, and the other harvesting `wifi.log`. The second prospector
starts a harvester for each file in the `apache2` directory and uses the `fields` configuration
option to add a field called `apache` to the output.
