=== Specifying Multiple Prospectors

A config file can contain multiple prospectors and multiple paths per prospector
as shown in the following example.

NOTE: Make sure a file is not defined more than once across all prospectors because this can lead
to unexpected behaviour.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat:
  prospectors:
    -
      paths:
        - /var/log/system.log
        - /var/log/wifi.log
    -
      paths:
        - "/var/log/apache2/*"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The config file in the example starts two prospectors. The first prospector has two harvesters,
one harvesting the `system.log` file, and the other harvesting `wifi.log`. The second prospector
starts a harvester for each file in the apache directory.
