[[configuration-general-options]]
== Specify general settings

You can specify settings in the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file to control the
general behavior of {beatname_uc}. This includes:

* <<configuration-global-options,Global options>> that control things like
publisher behavior and the location of some files.

* <<configuration-general,General options>> that are supported by all Elastic
Beats.

[float]
[[configuration-global-options]]
=== Global Filebeat configuration options

These options are in the `filebeat` namespace.

[float]
==== `registry.path`

The root path of the registry.  If a relative path is used, it is considered
relative to the data path. See the <<directory-layout>> section for details.
The default is `${path.data}/registry`.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.registry.path: registry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The registry is only updated when new events are flushed and not on a predefined period.
That means in case there are some states where the TTL expired, these are only removed when new event are processed.

NOTE: The registry stores it's data in the subdirectory filebeat/data.json. It
also contains a meta data file named filebeat/meta.json. The meta file contains
the file format version number.

NOTE: The content stored in filebeat/data.json is compatible to the old registry file data format.

[float]
==== `registry.file_permissions`

The permissions mask to apply on registry data file. The default value is 0600. The permissions option must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in octal notation. In Go, numbers in octal notation must start with 0.

The most permissive mask allowed is 0640. If a higher permissions mask is
specified via this setting, it will be subject to a umask of 0027.

This option is not supported on Windows.

Examples:

    0640: give read and write access to the file owner, and read access to members of the group associated with the file.
    0600: give read and write access to the file owner, and no access to all others.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.registry.file_permissions: 0600
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[float]
==== `registry.flush`


The timeout value that controls when registry entries are written to disk
(flushed). When an unwritten update exceeds this value, it triggers a write to
disk. When `registry.flush` is set to 0s, the registry is written to disk after
each batch of events has been published successfully. The default value is 0s.

NOTE: The registry is always updated when Filebeat shuts down normally. After an
abnormal shutdown, the registry will not be up-to-date if the `registry.flush`
value is >0s. Filebeat will send published events again (depending on values in
the last updated registry file).

NOTE: Filtering out a huge number of logs can cause many registry updates, slowing
down processing. Setting `registry.flush` to a value >0s reduces write operations,
helping Filebeat process more events.

[float]
==== `registry.migrate_file`

Prior to Filebeat 7.0 the registry is stored in a single file. When you upgrade
to 7.0, Filebeat will automatically migrate the old Filebeat 6.x registry file
to use the new directory format. Filebeat looks for the file in the location
specified by `filebeat.registry.path`. If you changed the path while upgrading,
set `filebeat.registry.migrate_file` to point to the old registry file.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.registry.path: ${path.data}/registry
filebeat.registry.migrate_file: /path/to/old/registry_file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The registry will be migrated to the new location only if a registry using the
directory format does not already exist.


[float]
==== `config_dir`

deprecated:[6.0.0, Use <<load-input-config>> instead.]

The full path to the directory that contains additional input configuration files.
Each configuration file must end with `.yml`. Each config file must also specify the full Filebeat
config hierarchy even though only the `inputs` part of each file is processed. All global
options, such as `registry_file`, are ignored.

The `config_dir` option MUST point to a directory other than the directory where the main Filebeat config file resides.

If the specified path is not absolute, it is considered relative to the configuration path. See the
<<directory-layout>> section for details.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.config_dir: path/to/configs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[float]
[[shutdown-timeout]]
==== `shutdown_timeout`

How long Filebeat waits on shutdown for the publisher to finish sending events
before Filebeat shuts down.

By default, this option is disabled, and Filebeat does not wait for the
publisher to finish sending events before shutting down. This means that any
events sent to the output, but not acknowledged before Filebeat shuts down,
are sent again when you restart Filebeat. For more details about how this
works, see <<at-least-once-delivery>>.

You can configure the `shutdown_timeout` option to specify the maximum amount
of time that Filebeat waits for the publisher to finish sending events before
shutting down. If all events are acknowledged before `shutdown_timeout` is
reached, Filebeat will shut down.

There is no recommended setting for this option because determining the correct
value for `shutdown_timeout` depends heavily on the environment in which
Filebeat is running and the current state of the output.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat.shutdown_timeout: 5s
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

include::{libbeat-dir}/generalconfig.asciidoc[]
