=== Command Line Options

Filebeat does not have any Filebeat-specific command line options. Instead, you
configure the behaviour of Filebeat by specifying options in the configuration file.

The following command line options from libbeat are also available for Filebeat. To
use these options, you need to start Filebeat in the foreground.

To start Filebeat, you must use the `-c config/path` option to specify the path to the
configuration file.

TIP: Run `./filebeat -h` to see the full list of options from the command line.
