=== Quick Start for Common Log Formats

beta[]

Filebeat provides a set of pre-built modules that you can use to rapidly
implement and deploy a log monitoring solution, complete with sample dashboards
and data visualizations, in about 5 minutes. These modules support common log
formats, such as Nginx, Apache2, and MySQL, and can be run by issuing a simple
command.

This topic shows you how to run the basic modules out of the box without extra
configuration. For detailed documentation and the full list of available
modules, see <<filebeat-modules>>.

If you are using a log file type that isn't supported by one of the available
Filebeat modules, you'll need to set up and configure Filebeat manually by
following the numbered steps under <<filebeat-getting-started>>. 

==== Prerequisites

Before running Filebeat with modules enabled, you need to:

* Install and configure the Elastic stack. See
{libbeat}/getting-started.html[Getting Started with Beats and the Elastic Stack].

* Complete the Filebeat installation instructions described in
<<filebeat-installation>>. After installing Filebeat, return to this
quick start page.

* Install the Ingest Node GeoIP and User Agent plugins. These plugins are
required to capture the geographical location and browser information used by
some of the visualizations available in the sample dashboards. You can install
these plugins by running the following commands in the Elasticsearch home path:
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-geoip
sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-user-agent
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
You need to restart Elasticsearch after running these commands.

* Verify that Elasticsearch and Kibana are running and that Elasticsearch is
ready to receive data from Filebeat.

==== Running Filebeat with Modules Enabled

To run one or more Filebeat modules, you issue the following command:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./filebeat -e -modules=MODULES -setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Where `MODULES` is the name of the module (or a comma-separated list of
modules) that you want to enable. The `-e` flag is optional and sends output
to standard error instead of syslog. The `-setup` flag is a one-time setup step.
For subsequent runs of Filebeat, do not specify this flag.

The following example starts Filebeat with the `system` module enabled and
loads the sample Kibana dashboards:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./filebeat -e -modules=system -setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This command takes care of configuring Filebeat, loading the recommended index
template for writing to Elasticsearch, and deploying the sample dashboards
for visualizing the data in Kibana.

NOTE: Depending on how you've installed Filebeat, you might see errors
related to file ownership or permissions when you try to run Filebeat modules.
See {libbeat}/config-file-permissions.html[Config File Ownership and Permissions]
in the _Beats Platform Reference_ if you encounter errors related to file
ownership or permissions.

To start Filebeat with the `system`, `nginx`, and `mysql` modules enabled
and load the sample dashboards, run:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./filebeat -e -modules=system,nginx,mysql -setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To start Filebeat with the `system` module enabled (it's assumed that
you've already loaded the sample dashboards), run:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./filebeat -e -modules=system
----------------------------------------------------------------------

TIP: In a production environment, you'll probably want to use a configuration
file, rather than command-line flags, to specify which modules to run. See the
detailed documentation for more about configuring and running modules.

These examples assume that the logs you're harvesting are in the location
expected for your OS and that the default behavior of Filebeat is appropriate
for your environment. Each module provides a set of variables that you can set
to fine tune the behavior of Filebeat, including the location where it looks
for log files. See <<filebeat-modules>> for more info.

[[visualizing-data]]
==== Visualizing the Data in Kibana

After you've confirmed that Filebeat is sending events to Elasticsearch, launch
the Kibana web interface by pointing your browser to port 5601. For example,
http://127.0.0.1:5601[http://127.0.0.1:5601].

Open the dashboard and explore the visualizations for your parsed logs.

Here's an example of the syslog dashboard:
