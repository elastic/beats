=== Compatibility

The +{modulename}+ module was tested with logs from versions 3.7.0.

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

The following example shows how to set paths in the +modules.d/{modulename}.yml+
file to override the default paths for logs:

[source,yaml]
-----
- module: zookeeper
  audit:
    enabled: true
    var.paths:
      - "/path/to/logs/audit.log*"
-----


To specify the same settings at the command line, you use:

[source,yaml]
-----
-M "zookeeper.audit.var.paths=[/path/to/logs/audit.log*]"
-----


//set the fileset name used in the included example
:fileset_ex: audit

include::../include/config-option-intro.asciidoc[]

==== `audit` fileset settings

include::../include/timezone-support.asciidoc[]
