=== Compatibility

The Pensando module has been tested with 1.12.0-E-54 and later

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]
The following example shows how to set parameters in the +modules.d/{modulename}.yml+
file to listen for firewall logs sent from the Pensando DSC(s) on port 5514 (default is 9001):

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
-----
- module: pensando
  access:
    enabled: true
    var.syslog_port: [5514]
-----
:fileset_ex: dfw

include::../include/config-option-intro.asciidoc[]

TODO: document the variables from each fileset. If you're describing a variable
that's common to other modules, you can reuse shared descriptions by including
the relevant file. For example:

[float]
==== `dfw` log fileset settings

include::../include/var-paths.asciidoc[]

[float]
=== Example dashboard

This module comes with a sample dashboard. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
