  description: >
    Fields from the Linux audit log. Not all fields are documented here because
    they are dynamic and vary by audit event type.
  fields:
    - name: old_auid
      description: >
        For login events this is the old audit ID used for the user prior to
        this login.
    - name: new_auid
      description: >
        For login events this is the new audit ID. The audit ID can be used to
        trace future events to the user even if their identity changes (like
        becoming root).
    - name: old_ses
      description: >
        For login events this is the old session ID used for the user prior to
        this login.
    - name: new_ses
      description: >
        For login events this is the new session ID. It can be used to tie a
        user to future events by session ID.
    - name: sequence
      type: long
      description: >
        The audit event sequence number.
    - name: items
      description: >

    - name: item
      description: >
        The item field indicates which item out of the total number of items.
        This number is zero-based; a value of 0 means it is the first item.
