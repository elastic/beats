== Redis module

experimental[]

This module has two filesets:

* The `log` fileset collects and parses the logs that Redis writes to disk.  The `slowlog` fileset
* connects to Redis via the network and retrieves the slow logs
  by using the `SLOWLOG` command.

For the `log` fileset, make sure the `logfile` option is set in the Redis configuration file. For
the `slowlog` fileset, make sure the `slowlog-log-slower-than` is set.

=== Compatibility

The Redis `log` fileset was tested with logs from Redis versions 1.2.6, 2.4.6, and 3.0.2, so we
expect compatibility with any version 1.x, 2.x, or 3.x.

On Windows, the default paths assume that Redis was installed from the Chocolatey repository.

The Redis `slowlog` fileset was tested with Redis 3.0.2 and 2.4.6. We expect compatibility with any
Redis version newer than 2.2.12, when the SLOWLOG command was added.
