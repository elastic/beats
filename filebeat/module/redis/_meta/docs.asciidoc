== Redis module

include::{libbeat-dir}/shared/integration-link.asciidoc[]

The +{modulename}+ module parses logs and slowlogs created by
https://redis.io/[Redis].

include::../include/what-happens.asciidoc[]

include::../include/gs-link.asciidoc[]

The +{modulename}+ module has two filesets:

* The `log` fileset collects and parses the logs that Redis writes to disk.  
* The `slowlog` fileset connects to Redis via the network and retrieves the slow logs
  by using the `SLOWLOG` command.

For the `log` fileset, make sure the `logfile` option, from the Redis
configuration file, is set to `redis-server.log`.

For the `slowlog` fileset, make sure the `slowlog-log-slower-than` option, from
the Redis configuration file, is set to a lower value than the default one.

=== Compatibility

The Redis `log` fileset was tested with logs from Redis versions 1.2.6, 2.4.6, and 3.0.2, so we
expect compatibility with any version 1.x, 2.x, or 3.x.

On Windows, the default paths assume that Redis was installed from the Chocolatey repository.

The Redis `slowlog` fileset was tested with Redis 3.0.2 and 2.4.6. We expect compatibility with any
Redis version newer than 2.2.12, when the SLOWLOG command was added.

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

The following example shows how to set paths in the +modules.d/{modulename}.yml+
file to override the default paths for Redis logs. It also shows how to set the
host and password to retrieve slow logs: 

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
-----
- module: redis
  log:
    enabled: true
    var.paths: ["/path/to/log/redis/redis-server.log*"]
  slowlog:
    enabled: true
    var.hosts: ["localhost:6378"]
    var.password: "{pwd}"
-----


To specify the same settings at the command line, you use:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
-----
-M "redis.log.var.paths=[/path/to/log/redis/redis-server.log*]" -M "redis.slowlog.var.hosts=[localhost:6378]" -M "redis.slowlog.var.password=[YOUR_PASSWORD]"
-----

==== `log` fileset settings

include::../include/var-paths.asciidoc[]

[float]
==== `slowlog` fileset settings

*`var.hosts`*::

An array of hosts to which Filebeat should connect to retrieve the slow logs. If
left empty, `localhost:6379` is assumed.

*`var.password`*::

The password to use to connect to Redis, in case Redis authentication is enabled
(the `requirepass` option in the Redis configuration).
