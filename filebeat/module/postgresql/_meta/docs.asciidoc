== PostgreSQL module

The +{modulename}+ module  collects and parses logs created by
https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL].

=== Compatibility

This module comes in two flavours: a parser of log files based on Linux distribution
defaults, and a CSV log parser, that you need to enable in database configuration.

The +{modulename}+ module using `.log` was tested with logs from versions 9.5 on Ubuntu,
 9.6 on Debian, and finally 10.11, 11.4 and 12.2 on Arch Linux 9.3.

The +{modulename}+ module using `.csv` was tested using versions 11 and 13 (distro is not relevant here).

include::../include/configuring-intro.asciidoc[]

The following example shows how to set paths in the +modules.d/{modulename}.yml+
file to override the default paths for PostgreSQL logs:


["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
-----
- module: postgresql
  log:
    enabled: true
    var.paths: ["/path/to/log/postgres/*.log*"]
-----


To specify the same settings at the command line, you use:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
-----
-M "postgresql.log.var.paths=[/path/to/log/postgres/*.log*]"
-----


//set the fileset name used in the included example

=== Example dashboards

This module comes with two sample dashboards.

The first dashboard is for regular logs.

The second one shows the slowlogs of PostgreSQL.

=== Using CSV logs

Since the PostgreSQL CSV log file is a well-defined format,
there is almost no configuration to be done in filebeat, just the filepath

On the other hand, it's necessary to configure postgresql to emit `.csv` logs.
The recommended parameters are:

```
logging_collector = 'on';
log_destination = 'csvlog';
log_statement = 'none';
log_checkpoints = on;
log_connections = on;
log_disconnections = on;
log_lock_waits = on;
log_min_duration_statement = 0;
```

In busy servers, `log_min_duration_statement` can cause contention, so you can assign
a value greater than 0.

Both `log_connections` and `log_disconnections` can cause a lot of events if you don't have
persistent connections, so enable with care.
