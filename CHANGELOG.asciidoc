Version 5.1.0 doesn't exist because, for a short period of time, the Elastic
Yum and Apt repositories included unreleased binaries labeled 5.1.0. To avoid
confusion and upgrade issues for the people that have installed these without
realizing, we decided to skip the 5.1.0 version and release 5.1.1 instead.
