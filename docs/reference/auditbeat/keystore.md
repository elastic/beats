# Secrets keystore for secure settings [keystore]


When you configure Auditbeat, you might need to specify sensitive settings, such as passwords. Rather than relying on file system permissions to protect these values, you can use the Auditbeat keystore to obfuscate stored secret values for use in configuration settings.

After adding a key and its secret value to the keystore, you can use the key in place of the secret value when you configure sensitive settings.

The syntax for referencing keys is identical to the syntax for environment variables:

`${KEY}`

Where KEY is the name of the key.

For example, imagine that the keystore contains a key called `ES_PWD` with the value `yourelasticsearchpassword`:

* In the configuration file, use `output.elasticsearch.password: "${ES_PWD}"`
* On the command line, use: `-E "output.elasticsearch.password=\${ES_PWD}"`

When Auditbeat unpacks the configuration, it resolves keys before resolving environment variables and other variables.

Notice that the Auditbeat keystore differs from the Elasticsearch keystore. Whereas the Elasticsearch keystore lets you store `elasticsearch.yml` values by name, the Auditbeat keystore lets you specify arbitrary names that you can reference in the Auditbeat configuration.

To create and manage keys, use the `keystore` command. See the [command reference](/reference/auditbeat/command-line-options.md#keystore-command) for the full command syntax, including optional flags.

::::{note}
The `keystore` command must be run by the same user who will run Auditbeat.
::::



## Create a keystore [creating-keystore]

To create a secrets keystore, use:

```sh
auditbeat keystore create
```

Auditbeat creates the keystore in the directory defined by the `path.data` configuration setting.


## Add keys [add-keys-to-keystore]

To store sensitive values, such as authentication credentials for Elasticsearch, use the `keystore add` command:

```sh
auditbeat keystore add ES_PWD
```

When prompted, enter a value for the key.

To overwrite an existing keyâ€™s value, use the `--force` flag:

```sh
auditbeat keystore add ES_PWD --force
```

To pass the value through stdin, use the `--stdin` flag. You can also use `--force`:

```sh
cat /file/containing/setting/value | auditbeat keystore add ES_PWD --stdin --force
```


## List keys [list-settings]

To list the keys defined in the keystore, use:

```sh
auditbeat keystore list
```


## Remove keys [remove-settings]

To remove a key from the keystore, use:

```sh
auditbeat keystore remove ES_PWD
```
