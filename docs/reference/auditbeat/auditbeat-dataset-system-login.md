# System login dataset [auditbeat-dataset-system-login]

::::{warning}
This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
::::


This is the `login` dataset of the system module.


## Implementation [_implementation]

The `login` dataset is implemented for Linux only.

On Linux, the dataset reads the [utmp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utmp) files that keep track of logins and logouts to the system. They are usually located at `/var/log/wtmp` (successful logins) and `/var/log/btmp` (failed logins).

The file patterns used to locate the files can be configured using `login.wtmp_file_pattern` and `login.btmp_file_pattern`. By default, both the current files and any rotated files (e.g. `wtmp.1`, `wtmp.2`) are read.

utmp files are binary, but you can display their contents using the `utmpdump` utility.


### Example dashboard [_example_dashboard_3]

The dataset comes with a sample dashboard:
