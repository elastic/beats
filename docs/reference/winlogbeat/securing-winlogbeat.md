# Secure Winlogbeat [securing-winlogbeat]


The following topics provide information about securing the Winlogbeat process and connecting to a cluster that has {{security-features}} enabled.

You can use role-based access control and optionally, API keys to grant Winlogbeat users access to secured resources.

* [*Grant users access to secured resources*](/reference/winlogbeat/feature-roles.md)
* [*Grant access using API keys*](/reference/winlogbeat/beats-api-keys.md).

After privileged users have been created, use authentication to connect to a secured Elastic cluster.

* [*Secure communication with Elasticsearch*](/reference/winlogbeat/securing-communication-elasticsearch.md)
* [*Secure communication with Logstash*](/reference/winlogbeat/configuring-ssl-logstash.md)
