# Contribute [contributing-to-beats]

The Beats are open source and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you!

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code that implements a whole new protocol, module, or Beat.

See [Contribute to Beats](../../extend/index.md)  for your one-stop shop for everything related to developing code for the Beats project.
