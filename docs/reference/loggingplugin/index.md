# Elastic logging plugin for Docker [log-driver-overview]

The Elastic Logging Plugin is a Docker plugin that sends container logs to the [{{stack}}](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack), where you can search, analyze, and visualize the data in real time.

The Elastic Logging Plugin is built on top of the [{{beats}}](https://www.elastic.co/beats) platform and supports many of the features and outputs supported by the {{beats}} shippers.

Beat users: see [*Known problems and limitations*](/reference/loggingplugin/log-driver-limitations.md).
