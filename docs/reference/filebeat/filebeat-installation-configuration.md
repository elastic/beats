# Filebeat quick start: installation and configuration [filebeat-installation-configuration]


This guide describes how to get started quickly with log collection. You’ll learn how to:

* install Filebeat on each system you want to monitor
* specify the location of your log files
* parse log data into fields and send it to {es}
* visualize the log data in {kib}

## Before you begin [_before_you_begin]

You need {{es}} for storing and searching your data, and {{kib}} for visualizing and managing it.

:::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} Elasticsearch Service
To get started quickly, spin up a deployment of our [hosted {{ess}}](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service). The {{ess}} is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. [Try it out for free](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Self-managed
To install and run {{es}} and {{kib}}, see [Installing the {{stack}}](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/deploy-cluster.md).
::::::

:::::::

## Step 1: Install Filebeat [installation]

Install Filebeat on all the servers you want to monitor.

To download and install Filebeat, use the commands that work with your system:

:::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} DEB
Version 9.0.0-beta1 of Filebeat has not yet been released.
::::::

::::::{tab-item} RPM
Version 9.0.0-beta1 of Filebeat has not yet been released.
::::::

::::::{tab-item} MacOS
Version 9.0.0-beta1 of Filebeat has not yet been released.
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Linux
Version 9.0.0-beta1 of Filebeat has not yet been released.
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Windows
Version 9.0.0-beta1 of Filebeat has not yet been released.
::::::

:::::::
The commands shown are for AMD platforms, but ARM packages are also available. Refer to the [download page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat) for the full list of available packages.


### Other installation options [other-installation-options]

* [APT or YUM](/reference/filebeat/setup-repositories.md)
* [Download page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat)
* [Docker](/reference/filebeat/running-on-docker.md)
* [Kubernetes](/reference/filebeat/running-on-kubernetes.md)
* [Cloud Foundry](/reference/filebeat/running-on-cloudfoundry.md)


## Step 2: Connect to the {{stack}} [set-connection]

Connections to {{es}} and {{kib}} are required to set up Filebeat.

Set the connection information in `filebeat.yml`. To locate this configuration file, see [Directory layout](/reference/filebeat/directory-layout.md).

:::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} Elasticsearch Service
Specify the [cloud.id](/reference/filebeat/configure-cloud-id.md) of your {{ess}}, and set [cloud.auth](/reference/filebeat/configure-cloud-id.md) to a user who is authorized to set up Filebeat. For example:

```yaml
cloud.id: "staging:dXMtZWFzdC0xLmF3cy5mb3VuZC5pbyRjZWM2ZjI2MWE3NGJmMjRjZTMzYmI4ODExYjg0Mjk0ZiRjNmMyY2E2ZDA0MjI0OWFmMGNjN2Q3YTllOTYyNTc0Mw=="
cloud.auth: "filebeat_setup:{pwd}" <1>
```

1. This examples shows a hard-coded password, but you should store sensitive values in the [secrets keystore](/reference/filebeat/keystore.md).
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Self-managed
1. Set the host and port where Filebeat can find the {{es}} installation, and set the username and password of a user who is authorized to set up Filebeat. For example:

    ```yaml
    output.elasticsearch:
      hosts: ["https://myEShost:9200"]
      username: "filebeat_internal"
      password: "{pwd}" <1>
      ssl:
        enabled: true
        ca_trusted_fingerprint: "b9a10bbe64ee9826abeda6546fc988c8bf798b41957c33d05db736716513dc9c" <2>
    ```

    1. This example shows a hard-coded password, but you should store sensitive values in the [secrets keystore](/reference/filebeat/keystore.md).
    2. This example shows a hard-coded fingerprint, but you should store sensitive values in the [secrets keystore](/reference/filebeat/keystore.md). The fingerprint is a HEX encoded SHA-256 of a CA certificate, when you start {{es}} for the first time, security features such as network encryption (TLS) for {{es}} are enabled by default. If you are using the self-signed certificate generated by {{es}} when it is started for the first time, you will need to add its fingerprint here. The fingerprint is printed on {{es}} start up logs, or you can refer to [connect clients to {{es}} documentation](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/security-certificates-keys.md#_connect_clients_to_es_5) for other options on retrieving it. If you are providing your own SSL certificate to {{es}} refer to [Filebeat documentation on how to setup SSL](/reference/filebeat/configuration-ssl.md#ssl-client-config).

2. If you plan to use our pre-built {{kib}} dashboards, configure the {{kib}} endpoint. Skip this step if {{kib}} is running on the same host as {{es}}.

    ```yaml
      setup.kibana:
        host: "mykibanahost:5601" <1>
        username: "my_kibana_user" <2> <3>
        password: "{pwd}"
    ```

    1. The hostname and port of the machine where {{kib}} is running, for example, `mykibanahost:5601`. If you specify a path after the port number, include the scheme and port: `http://mykibanahost:5601/path`.
    2. The `username` and `password` settings for {{kib}} are optional. If you don’t specify credentials for {{kib}}, Filebeat uses the `username` and `password` specified for the {{es}} output.
    3. To use the pre-built {{kib}} dashboards, this user must be authorized to view dashboards or have the `kibana_admin` [built-in role](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md).
::::::

:::::::
To learn more about required roles and privileges, see [*Grant users access to secured resources*](/reference/filebeat/feature-roles.md).

::::{note}
You can send data to other [outputs](/reference/filebeat/configuring-output.md), such as {{ls}}, but that requires additional configuration and setup.

## Step 3: Collect log data [collect-log-data]

There are several ways to collect log data with Filebeat:

* Data collection modules — simplify the collection, parsing, and visualization of common log formats
* ECS loggers — structure and format application logs into ECS-compatible JSON
* Manual Filebeat configuration


### Enable and configure data collection modules [enable-modules]

1. Identify the modules you need to enable. To see a list of available [modules](/reference/filebeat/filebeat-modules.md), run:

    :::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} DEB
```sh
    filebeat modules list
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} RPM
```sh
    filebeat modules list
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} MacOS
```sh
    ./filebeat modules list
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Linux
```sh
    ./filebeat modules list
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Windows
```sh
    PS > .\filebeat.exe modules list
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} DEB
```sh
    filebeat modules enable nginx
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} RPM
```sh
    filebeat modules enable nginx
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} MacOS
```sh
    ./filebeat modules enable nginx
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Linux
```sh
    ./filebeat modules enable nginx
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Windows
```sh
    PS > .\filebeat.exe modules enable nginx
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} DEB
```sh
    filebeat setup -e
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} RPM
```sh
    filebeat setup -e
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} MacOS
```sh
    ./filebeat setup -e
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Linux
```sh
    ./filebeat setup -e
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Windows
```sh
    PS > .\filebeat.exe setup -e
    ```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} DEB
```sh
sudo service filebeat start
```

::::{note}
If you use an `init.d` script to start Filebeat, you can’t specify command line flags (see [Command reference](/reference/filebeat/command-line-options.md)). To specify flags, start Filebeat in the foreground.
::::


Also see [Filebeat and systemd](/reference/filebeat/running-with-systemd.md).
::::::

::::::{tab-item} RPM
```sh
sudo service filebeat start
```

::::{note}
If you use an `init.d` script to start Filebeat, you can’t specify command line flags (see [Command reference](/reference/filebeat/command-line-options.md)). To specify flags, start Filebeat in the foreground.
::::


Also see [Filebeat and systemd](/reference/filebeat/running-with-systemd.md).
::::::

::::::{tab-item} MacOS
```sh
sudo chown root filebeat.yml <1>
sudo chown root modules.d/nginx.yml <1>
sudo ./filebeat -e
```

1. You’ll be running Filebeat as root, so you need to change ownership of the configuration file and any configurations enabled in the `modules.d` directory, or run Filebeat with `--strict.perms=false` specified. See [Config File Ownership and Permissions](/reference/libbeat/config-file-permissions.md).
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Linux
```sh
sudo chown root filebeat.yml <1>
sudo chown root modules.d/nginx.yml <1>
sudo ./filebeat -e
```

1. You’ll be running Filebeat as root, so you need to change ownership of the configuration file and any configurations enabled in the `modules.d` directory, or run Filebeat with `--strict.perms=false` specified. See [Config File Ownership and Permissions](/reference/libbeat/config-file-permissions.md).
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Windows
```sh
PS C:\Program Files\filebeat> Start-Service filebeat
```

By default, Windows log files are stored in `C:\ProgramData\filebeat\Logs`.
::::::

:::::::
Filebeat should begin streaming events to {{es}}.


## Step 6: View your data in {{kib}} [view-data]

Filebeat comes with pre-built {{kib}} dashboards and UIs for visualizing log data. You loaded the dashboards earlier when you ran the `setup` command.

To open the dashboards:

1. Launch {{kib}}:

    <div class="tabs" data-tab-group="host">
      <div role="tablist" aria-label="Open Kibana">
        <button role="tab"
                aria-selected="true"
                aria-controls="cloud-tab-open-kibana"
                id="cloud-open-kibana">
          Elasticsearch Service
        </button>
        <button role="tab"
                aria-selected="false"
                aria-controls="self-managed-tab-open-kibana"
                id="self-managed-open-kibana"
                tabindex="-1">
          Self-managed
        </button>
      </div>
      <div tabindex="0"
           role="tabpanel"
           id="cloud-tab-open-kibana"
           aria-labelledby="cloud-open-kibana">
    1. [Log in](https://cloud.elastic.co/) to your {{ecloud}} account.
    2. Navigate to the {{kib}} endpoint in your deployment.

      </div>
      <div tabindex="0"
           role="tabpanel"
           id="self-managed-tab-open-kibana"
           aria-labelledby="self-managed-open-kibana"
           hidden="">
    Point your browser to [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601), replacing `localhost` with the name of the {{kib}} host.

      </div>
    </div>

2. In the side navigation, click **Discover**. To see Filebeat data, make sure the predefined `filebeat-*` data view is selected.

    ::::{tip}
    If you don’t see data in {{kib}}, try changing the time filter to a larger range. By default, {{kib}} shows the last 15 minutes.
    ::::

3. In the side navigation, click **Dashboard**, then select the dashboard that you want to open.

The dashboards are provided as examples. We recommend that you [customize](docs-content://explore-analyze/dashboards.md) them to meet your needs.


## What’s next? [_whats_next]

Now that you have your logs streaming into {{es}}, learn how to unify your logs, metrics, uptime, and application performance data.

1. Ingest data from other sources by installing and configuring other Elastic {{beats}}:
