# Step 2: Enable the take over mode [_step_2_enable_the_take_over_mode]

Now, to indicate that the new `filestream` is supposed to take over the files from a previously defined `log` input, we need to add `take_over: true` to each new `filestream`. This will make sure that the new `filestream` inputs will continue ingesting files from the same offset where the `log` inputs stopped.

::::{note}
Itâ€™s recommended to enable debug-level logs for Filebeat in order to follow the migration process. After the first run with `take_over: true` the setting can be removed.
::::


::::{warning}
The `take over` mode is in beta.
::::


::::{important}
If this parameter is not set, all the files will be re-ingested from the beginning and this will lead to data duplication. Please, double-check that this parameter is set.
