# Advanced usage [configuration-autodiscover-advanced]

::::{warning}
If you still have `log`  or `container` inputs in your autodiscover templates please follow [our official guide](/reference/filebeat/migrate-to-filestream.md) to migrate existing `log` inputs to `filestream` inputs.

The `log` input is deprecated in version 7.16 and disabled in version 9.0.

## Appenders [_appenders]

Appenders allow users to append configuration that is already built with the help of either templates or builders. Appenders can be configured to be applied only when a required condition is matched. The kind of configuration that is applied is specific to each appender.


### Config [_config_2]

The config appender can apply a config on top of the config that was generated by templates or builders. The config is applied whenever a provided condition is matched. It is always applied if there is no condition provided.

```yaml
filebeat.autodiscover:
  providers:
    - type: kubernetes
      templates:
        ...
      appenders:
        - type: config
          condition.equals:
            kubernetes.namespace: "prometheus"
          config:
            fields:
              type: monitoring
```
