# Step 4 [_step_4]

The events produced by `filestream` input with `take_over: true` contain a `take_over` tag. You can filter on this tag in Kibana and see the events which came from a filestream in the "take_over" mode.

Once you start receiving events with this tag, you can remove `take_over: true` and restart the fileinput again.
