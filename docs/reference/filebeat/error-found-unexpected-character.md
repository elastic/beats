# Found unexpected or unknown characters [error-found-unexpected-character]

Either there is a problem with the structure of your config file, or you have used a path or expression that the YAML parser cannot resolve because the config file contains characters that arenâ€™t properly escaped.

If the YAML file contains paths with spaces or unusual characters, wrap the paths in single quotation marks (see [Wrap paths in single quotation marks](/reference/filebeat/yaml-tips.md#wrap-paths-in-quotes)).

Also see the general advice under [*Avoid YAML formatting problems*](/reference/filebeat/yaml-tips.md).
