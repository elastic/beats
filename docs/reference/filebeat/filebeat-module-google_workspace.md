# Google Workspace module [filebeat-module-google_workspace]

:::::{admonition} Prefer to use {{agent}} for this use case?
Refer to the [Elastic Integrations documentation](integration-docs://reference/google_workspace.md).

::::{dropdown} Learn more
{{agent}} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and more. Refer to the documentation for a detailed [comparison of {{beats}} and {{agent}}](docs-content://reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/index.md).

This is a module for ingesting data from the different Google Workspace audit reports APIs.

## Configure the module [_configure_the_module]

In order for Filebeat to ingest data from the Google Reports API you must:

* Have an **administrator account**, as described [here](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/prerequisites).
* [Set up a ServiceAccount](https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/9222993?hl=en) using the administrator account.
* [Set up access to the Admin SDK API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/authorizing) for the ServiceAccount.
* [Enable Domain-Wide Delegation](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/delegation) for your ServiceAccount.

This module will make use of the following **oauth2 scope**:

* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly`

Once you have downloaded your service account credentials as a JSON file, you can set up your module:


#### Configuration options [_configuration_options_42]

```yaml
- module: google_workspace
  saml:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  user_accounts:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  login:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  admin:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  drive:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  groups:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
```

Every fileset has the following configuration options:

**`var.jwt_file`**
:   Specifies the path to the JWT credentials file.

**`var.delegated_account`**
:   Email of the admin user used to access the API.

**`var.http_client_timeout`**
:   Duration of the time limit on HTTP requests made by the module. Defaults to `60s`.

**`var.interval`**
:   Duration between requests to the API. Defaults to `2h`.

::::{note}
Google Workspace defaults to a 2 hour polling interval because Google reports can go from some minutes up to 3 days of delay. For more details on this, you can read more [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566).
::::


**`var.user_key`**
:   Specifies the user key to fetch reports from. Defaults to `all`.

**`var.initial_interval`**
:   It will poll events up to this time period when the module starts. This is to prevent polling too many or repeated events on module restarts. Defaults to `24h`.


### Google Workspace Reports ECS fields [_google_workspace_reports_ecs_fields]

This is a list of Google Workspace Reports fields that are mapped to ECS.
