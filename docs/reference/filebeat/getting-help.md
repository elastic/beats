# Get help [getting-help]

Start by searching the [Filebeat discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats/filebeat) for your issue. If you can’t find a resolution, open a new issue or add a comment to an existing one. Make sure you provide the following information, and we’ll help you troubleshoot the problem:

* Filebeat version
* Operating System
* Configuration
* Any supporting information, such as debugging output, that will help us diagnose your problem. See [*Debug*](/reference/filebeat/enable-filebeat-debugging.md) for more details.

If you’re sure you found a bug, you can open a ticket on [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues?state=open). Note, however, that we close GitHub issues containing questions or requests for help if they don’t indicate the presence of a bug.
