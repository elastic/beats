{{agent}} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and more. Refer to the documentation for a detailed [comparison of {{beats}} and {{agent}}](docs-content://reference/fleet/index.md).

::::{note}
The Salesforce module has been completely revamped to use a new dedicated Salesforce input for event collection, replacing the previous HTTPJSON input method. This change brings improved performance and reliability. However, please be aware that this update introduces a breaking change. We believe this is the right time to make this necessary improvement as the previous module was in beta.
::::


The Salesforce module collects logs from a Salesforce instance using the Salesforce REST API. It supports real-time and historical data collection for various log types including Login, Logout, APEX, and Setup Audit Trail.

The Salesforce module contains the following filesets for collecting different types of logs:

* The `login` fileset collects Login events from the EventLogFile or Objects (real-time).
* The `logout` fileset collects Logout events from the EventLogFile or Objects (real-time).
* The `apex` fileset collects APEX execution logs from the EventLogFile.
* The `setupaudittrail` fileset collects Audit Trails events generated when admins make configuration changes in the orgâ€™s Setup area from the Objects (real-time).

| Fileset | EventLogFile | Objects (real-time) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| login | yes | yes |
| logout | yes | yes |
| apex | yes | no |
| setupaudittrail | no | yes |

::::{important}
The default interval for collecting logs (`var.real_time_interval` or `var.elf_interval`) is 5m/1h. Exercise caution when reducing this interval, as it directly impacts the Salesforce API rate limit of ~1000 calls per hour. Exceeding the limit will result in errors from the Salesforce API. Refer to the [Salesforce API Rate Limit](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet.meta/salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet/salesforce_app_limits_platform_api.htm) documentation for more details.
