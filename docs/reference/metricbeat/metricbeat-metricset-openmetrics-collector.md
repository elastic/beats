This is the `collector` metricset of the Openmetrics module. It collects metrics from endpoints that follow Openmetrics format.

This is a default metricset. If the host module is unconfigured, this metricset is enabled by default.

## Fields [_fields_196]

For a description of each field in the metricset, see the [exported fields](/reference/metricbeat/exported-fields-openmetrics.md) section.
