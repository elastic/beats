# Google Cloud Platform pubsub metricset [metricbeat-metricset-gcp-pubsub]

PubSub metricsetf fetches metrics from [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) topics and subscriptions in Google Cloud Platform.

The `pubsub` metricset contains all GA stage metrics exported from the [Stackdriver API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-pubsub). The field names are aligned to [Beats naming conventions](/extend/event-conventions.md) with minor modifications to their GCP metrics name counterpart.

No special permissions are needed apart from the ones detailed in the module section of the docs.

This is a default metricset. If the host module is unconfigured, this metricset is enabled by default.

## Fields [_fields_107]

For a description of each field in the metricset, see the [exported fields](/reference/metricbeat/exported-fields-gcp.md) section.
