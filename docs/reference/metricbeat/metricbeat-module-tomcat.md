# Tomcat module [metricbeat-module-tomcat]

::::{warning}
This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

:::::{admonition} Prefer to use {{agent}} for this use case?
Refer to the [Elastic Integrations documentation](integration-docs://reference/tomcat.md).

::::{dropdown} Learn more
{{agent}} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and more. Refer to the documentation for a detailed [comparison of {{beats}} and {{agent}}](docs-content://reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/index.md).

```yaml
metricbeat.modules:
- module: tomcat
  metricsets: ['threading', 'cache', 'memory', 'requests']
  period: 10s
  hosts: ['localhost:8080']
  path: "/jolokia/?ignoreErrors=true&canonicalNaming=false"
```
