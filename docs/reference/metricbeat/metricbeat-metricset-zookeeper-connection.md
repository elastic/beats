# ZooKeeper connection metricset [metricbeat-metricset-zookeeper-connection]

`connection` Metricset fetches the data returned by the `cons` admin keyword. It exposes the following metrics:

* `zookeeper.connection.interest_ops`: Interest ops
* `zookeeper.connection.queued`: Queued connections
* `zookeeper.connection.received`: Received connections
* `zookeeper.connection.sent`: Connections sent

## Fields [_fields_266]

For a description of each field in the metricset, see the [exported fields](/reference/metricbeat/exported-fields-zookeeper.md) section.
