# Linux rapl metricset [metricbeat-metricset-linux-rapl]

::::{warning}
This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

The RAPL metricset reports power usage in Watts as reported by Intelâ€™s RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) API. In practice, RAPL is used for setting power usage limits on a CPU, but it can also be used for monitoring power usage.

RAPL is available on most Intel CPUs in some form since Sandy Bridge, however, this implementation requires a linux distro that exposes intel MSRs (model-specific registers) via `/dev/cpu/[CPU]/msr`. You can check to see if your linux distro and CPU support RAPL by running

```
sudo rdmsr 0x606
```

If that command returns a hex value such as `a1003`, RAPL is supported.

RAPL divides a CPU into four domains, each one corresponding to a component within the hardware itself: `Package`, `DRAM`, `PP0` (usually the collective power usage of the cores), and `PP1` (usually the integrated GPU). Not all packages are available on all CPUs, and the RAPL metricset will report all RAPL domains that it finds.


## msr-safe usage [_msr_safe_usage]

This metricset also supports [msr-safe](https://github.com/LLNL/msr-safe), which allows a user to access an MSR device without root. The `rapl.use_msr_safe` flag in the linux module config will enable usage of the `/dev/cpu/[CPU]/msr_safe` device.

For existing msr-safe installs, the following allowlist will open all RAPL MSRs for reading:
