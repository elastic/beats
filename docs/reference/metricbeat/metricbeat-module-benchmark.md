{{agent}} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and more. Refer to the documentation for a detailed [comparison of {{beats}} and {{agent}}](docs-content://manage-data/ingest/tools.md).

The `benchmark` module is used to generate synthetic metrics at a predictable rate.  This can be useful when you want to test output settings or test system sizing without using real data.

The `benchmark` module metricset is `info`.

```yaml
- module: benchmark
  metricsets:
    - info
  enabled: true
  period: 10s
```


## Metricsets [_metricsets_13]


### `info` [_info_2]

A metric that includes a `counter` field which is used to keep the metric unique.


### Module-specific configuration notes [_module_specific_configuration_notes_3]

`count`
:   number, the number of metrics to emit per fetch.


### Example configuration [_example_configuration_9]

The Benchmark module supports the standard configuration options that are described in [Modules](configuration-metricbeat.md). Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
metricbeat.modules:
- module: benchmark
  metricsets:
    - info
  enabled: false
  period: 10s
```


### Metricsets [_metricsets_14]

The following metricsets are available:
