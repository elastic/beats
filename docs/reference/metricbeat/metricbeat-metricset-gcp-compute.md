# Google Cloud Platform compute metricset [metricbeat-metricset-gcp-compute]

Compute metricset to fetch metrics from [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) Virtual Machines in Google Cloud Platform. No Monitoring or Logging agent is required in your instances to use this metricset.

The `compute` metricset contains all metrics exported from the [Stackdriver API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-compute). The field names are aligned to [Beats naming conventions](/extend/event-conventions.md) with minor modifications to their GCP metrics name counterpart.

Extra labels and metadata are also extracted using the [Compute API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/get). This is enough to get most of the info associated with a metric like Compute labels and metadata and metric specific Labels.


## Labels [_labels]

Here is a list of labels collected by `compute` metricset depending on the type of metric being collected:

* `instance_name`: The name of the VM instance. Collected with:

    * `gcp.instance.firewall.*`
    * `gcp.instance.cpu.*`
    * `gcp.instance.disk.*`
    * `gcp.instance.memory.*`
    * `gcp.instance.network.*`
    * `gcp.instance.uptime`

* `device_name`: The name of the disk device. Collected with:

    * `gcp.instance.disk.*`

* `storage_type`: The storage type: `pd-standard`, `pd-ssd`, or `local-ssd`. Collected with:

    * `gcp.instance.disk.*`

* `device_type`: The disk type: `ephemeral` or `permanent`. Collected with:

    * `gcp.instance.disk.*`

* `loadBalanced`: Whether traffic was sent from an L3 loadbalanced IP address assigned to the VM. Traffic that is externally routed from the VMâ€™s standard internal or external IP address, such as L7 loadbalanced traffic, is not considered to be loadbalanced in this metric. Collected with:

    * `gcp.instance.network.*`


This is a default metricset. If the host module is unconfigured, this metricset is enabled by default.

## Fields [_fields_101]

For a description of each field in the metricset, see the [exported fields](/reference/metricbeat/exported-fields-gcp.md) section.
