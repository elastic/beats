# Not sure whether to use Logstash or Beats [diff-logstash-beats]

Beats are lightweight data shippers that you install as agents on your servers to send specific types of operational data to {{es}}. Beats have a small footprint and use fewer system resources than {{ls}}.

{{ls}} has a larger footprint, but provides a broad array of input, filter, and output plugins for collecting, enriching, and transforming data from a variety of sources.

For more information, see the [{{ls}} Introduction](logstash://reference/index.md) and the [Beats Overview](/reference/index.md).
