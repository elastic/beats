# SyncGateway replication metricset [metricbeat-metricset-syncgateway-replication]

::::{warning}
This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

SyncGateway `replication` metriset contains information about the replicas. Note that you won’t see any data if you don’t have any replicas configured on your Couchbase buckets.

## Fields [_fields]

For a description of each field in the metricset, see the [exported fields](/reference/metricbeat/exported-fields-syncgateway.md) section.
