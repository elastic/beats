# Community Beats [community-beats]

::::{admonition}
**Custom Beat generator code no longer available in 8.0 and later**

The custom Beat generator was a helper tool that allowed developers to bootstrap their custom {{beats}}. This tool was deprecated in 7.16 and is no longer available starting in 8.0.

Developers can continue to create custom {{beats}} to address specific and targeted use cases. If you need to create a Beat from scratch, you can use the custom Beat generator tool available in version 7.16 or 7.17 to generate the custom Beat, then upgrade its various components to the 8.x release.

::::


This page lists some of the {{beats}} developed by the open source community.

Have a question about developing a community Beat? You can post questions and discuss issues in the [{{beats}} discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/tags/c/elastic-stack/beats/28/beats-development).

Have you created a Beat that’s not listed? Add the name and description of your Beat to the source document for [Community {{beats}}](https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/main/libbeat/docs/communitybeats.asciidoc) and [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) in the [{{beats}} GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/beats) to get your change merged. When you’re ready, go ahead and [announce](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements) your new Beat in the Elastic discussion forum.
