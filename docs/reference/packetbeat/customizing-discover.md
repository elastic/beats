# Customize the Discover page [customizing-discover]

To make it easier for you to search and discover Packetbeat data in Kibana, the sample dashboards contain predefined searches. These searches are not default views on the **Discover** page. To use these searches, make sure you’ve [set up the example Kibana dashboards](/reference/packetbeat/load-kibana-dashboards.md). Then go to the **Discover** page and click **Open**.

Type `Packetbeat` in the Search field to filter the list of searches.
