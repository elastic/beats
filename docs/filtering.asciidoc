== Kibana Query and Filter

=== Kibana Query

The search field under the *Discover* page provides a way to query 
a specific subset of the transactions from the selected time frame.
The query syntax is based on the 
http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_5_0/queryparsersyntax.html[Lucene query syntax]. 
It allows boolean operators, wildcards and field filtering. For example, if 
you want to find the http redirects, you can search for
`type: http AND http.code: 302`.

==== String Query

A query may consists of one or more words or a phrase. A phrase is a
group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "test search".

To search for all http requests initiated by Mozilla Web browser version 5.0:

[source,yaml]
---------------
"Mozilla/5.0"
--------------

To search for all the transactions that contain the following message:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------
"Cannot change the info of a user"
------------------------------------

Note: Double quotes are mandatory here to search for the exact
string. Without any quotes, the search would match documents containing one of the following words:"Cannot" OR "change" OR "the" OR "info" OR "a" OR "user".

To search for all transactions with the "chunked" encoding:

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------
"Transfer-Encoding: chunked"
-----------------------------

==== Field-based Query

To only view HTTP transactions:

[source,yaml]
--------------------
type: http
-------------------

To only view failed transactions:

[source,yaml]
-------------------
status: Error
-------------------


To only view MySQL INSERT queries:

[source,yaml]
---------------------
mysql.method: INSERT
---------------------

==== Regexp Query

Kibana supports regular expression for filters and expressions.  For example,
to search for all http responses with json as returned value type: 

[source,yaml]
-------------------------
http.content_type: *json
-------------------------

See
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-regexp-query.html[Elasticsearch regexp query]
for more details about the syntax.


==== Range Query

Range queries allow a field to have values between the lower and upper bound.
The interval can include or exclude the bounds depending on the type of
brackets used.

To search for slow transactions with a responsetime greater or equal than 10ms:

[source,yaml]
------------------------
responsetime: [10 TO *]
------------------------


To search for slow transactions with a responsetime greater than 10ms:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------
responsetime: {10 TO *}
-------------------------

==== Bool Query 

Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) allow combining multiple sub queries through logic operators.
Note: Operators such as AND, OR and NOT must be CAPITALIZED. See http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_5_0/queryparsersyntax.html[Lucene query syntax] for more details about the boolean operators.

To search for all transactions except MySQL transactions:

[source,yaml]
----------------
NOT type: mysql
---------------


To search for all MySQL SELECT queries with large attachments:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------
mysql.method: SELECT AND mysql.size: [10000 TO *]
-------------------------------------------------


Lucene also supports parentheses to group sub queries.

To search for either INSERT or UPDATE MySQL queries with a responsetime greater or equal with 30ms:

[source,yaml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(mysql.method: INSERT OR mysql.method: UPDATE) AND responsetime: [30 TO *]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Kibana Filter

In Kibana, the transactions can be filtered either by entering a search query or by clicking on
the elements within the visualization. For example, to filter for all the http redirects that are coming from a specific
IP and port, click on both green sections of `client_ip` and `client_port` fields from the transaction detail widget. To
exclude the http redirects coming from the IP and port, use the red sections.

The selected filters appear under the search box.
