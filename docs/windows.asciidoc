== Installing Packetbeat on Windows

This page walks you through the steps required for installing and running Packetbeat on
Windows. It assumes your Windows system has Powershell installed.

For information about installing on other platforms, see <<packetbeat-getting-started>>.

To install and run Packetbeat:

. Download and install WinPcap from this
http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm[page]. WinPcap is a library that uses
a driver to enable packet capturing.

. Download the Packetbeat Windows zip file from the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/packetbeat[downloads page] and unzip
it on your computer. The location where you extract the file is not important, but
remember that you shouldn't delete this repository after the installation is
finished. The exe file and the configuration file will continue to live there.

. Start an Administrator Powershell session (right click the Powershell icon
and select *Run as Administrator*), and navigate to where you extracted the
zip file.

Use the following command to list the available network interfaces:
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PS > .\packetbeat.exe -devices

0: \Device\NPF_{113535AD-934A-452E-8D5F-3004797DE286} (Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Desktop Adapter)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
In this example, there is only one network card installed on the system. If
there are multiple network cards, remember the index of the device you want to use for
capturing the traffic.

. Edit the `packetbeat.yml` file and modify the `device` line to point to the
index of the device:
+
[source,yml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
interfaces:
  device: 0
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
You might want to change other settings in the `packetbeat.yml` file. See
 <<packetbeat-configuration>> for details.

=== Installing Packetbeat as a Windows Service
