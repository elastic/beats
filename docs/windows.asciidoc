== Windows shipper

The Packetbeat shipper supports running on Windows, but to get it up and running
involves a few manual steps. This article explains how to use
http://nssm.cc/[NSSM] to run the Packetbeat shipper as a Windows service.

=== Prerequisites

Start by creating a `C:\Packetbeat` folder as your main workspace. You can put
this folder anywhere you like, but to keep things clear we'll assume it's directly
under `C:`.

* Download and install WinPcap from this
  http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm[page]. WinPcap is a library that
  uses a driver to enable packet capturing from the connected network devices.
  This is the same library that http://wireshark.org[Wireshark] uses.

* Download WinDump.exe from this
  http://www.winpcap.org/windump/install/default.htm[page] and simply save it
  in the `C:\Packetbeat` folder. We'll only use WinDump to find the available
  network devices names.

* Download the NSSM zip from http://nssm.cc/download[here] and extract it
  also under `C:\Packetbeat`. The zip contains both the source file and the binaries.

=== Download and configure the Packetbeat shipper

Now download the shipper from our https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/packetbeat[download page].
We provide 32 bit and 64 bit binaries, so choose the one that fits your
system. Please save it and extract it under `C:\Packetbeat` as well.

We'll do the rest from the Command Prompt, and we need administrator rights for
some of the actions. You can start the Command Prompt with administrator privileges
like this:

1. Click *Start*, click *All Programs*, and then click *Accessories*.
2. Right-click *Command prompt*, and then click *Run as administrator*.
3. If the *User Account Control* dialog box appears, confirm that the action it
   displays is what you want, and then click *Continue*.

Go to the Packetbeat folder and execute WinDump like this to list the available
devices:

[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------
C:\Windows\system32> cd C:\Packetbeat
C:\Packetbeat> WinDump.exe -D
-----------------------------------------------

The above will print the available network devices. On my system, the name is
this: `\Device\NPF_{C83D2DB0-8C89-4CFB-B526-B4E1A5B9D0F3}`. Now open the
`packetbeat.yml` file from the Packetbeat folder. You can edit it with
Notepad or any other editor. Look for the `device: "any"` line and replace
the string with the one printed by WinDump. Note that you have to escape the
backslashes, so you should have something like this:

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------------------
interfaces:
  device: "\\Device\\NPF_{C83D2DB0-8C89-4CFB-B526-B4E1A5B9D0F3}"
-----------------------------------------------

You might need to change more settings in this configuration file, please
refer to our <<packetbeat-getting-started,Getting Started>> guide.

Save the file and return to the Command Prompt.

=== Create the service

Now go to the NSSM directory. Use the `Win32` folder if you are on 32 bits and
the `Win64` folder if you are on 64 bits:

[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------
C:\Packetbeat> cd nssm-2.22\win32
-----------------------------------------------

Create the new service:

[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------
C:\Packetbeat\nssm-2.22\win32> nssm.exe install packetbeat
-----------------------------------------------

A graphical interface will be started. In the *Path* input, select the
`packetbeat.exe` file. In the *Arguments* line, type: `-c packetbeat.yml`. If
you used the paths suggested above, the configuration should look something like
this:

image:./images/nssm_install.png[NSSM install]

Select the *I/O* tab, and for the *Output (stdout)* and *Error (stderr)*
fields, select a file in a location that appropriate for the logs written by
the Packetbeat shipper.

Finally, switch to the *File rotation* tab and check the *Rotate files* and
the *Rotate while service is running* checkboxes.

Click the *Install service* button. If things go well, you'll get a success
notification. Click *OK* and return to the Command Prompt.

Now you can start the service:

[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------
C:\Packetbeat\nssm-2.22\win32> nssm.exe start packetbeat
-----------------------------------------------

If everything goes fine, it should print that the operation was successful and
the `log.txt` should be now created.

That's it! If you have Elasticsearch and Kibana installed, you should now see
the transactions in the web interface.
