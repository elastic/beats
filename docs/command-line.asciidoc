These command line options are specific to Packetbeat. For command line options common to all Beats, see {libbeat}/command-line-options.html[Beats Command Line Options].

*`-I <file>`*::
Pass a pcap file as input to Packetbeat instead of reading packets from the network. 
This option is useful only for testing Packetbeat. Example: `-I ~/pcaps/network_traffic.pcap`.

*`-O`*::
Read packets one by one by pressing _Enter_ after each. This option is useful only for testing Packetbeat.

*`-devices`*::
Print the list of devices that are available for sniffing.

*`-dump <file>`*::
Write all captured packets to a file. This option is useful for troubleshooting Packetbeat.

*`-l <n>`*::
Read the pcap file `n` number of times. Use this option in combination with the `-I` option. 
For an infinite loop, use _0_. The `-l` option is useful only for testing Packetbeat.

*`-t`*::
Read the packets from the pcap file as fast as possible without sleeping. Use this option in combination with the `-I` option. The `-t` option is useful only for testing Packetbeat.
