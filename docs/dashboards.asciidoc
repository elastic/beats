== Sample dashboards

In order to make it as easy as possible to get application performance insights
from packet data, we provide a few sample Kibana dashboards. The
dashboards are maintained in this
https://github.com/elastic/packetbeat-dashboards[GitHub repository], which also
includes instructions for loading them.

The project currently contains the following dashboards:

* *Performance dashboard*: contains platform wide visualizations, including the
  map of the client locations, request per minute counts for each protocol, the
  latency distribution diagram and the response times percentiles.

* *MySQL performance*: This page demonstrates more advanced statistics like the
  top 10 slow MySQL queries, most frequent MySQL queries, the database
  throughput or the database response times.

* *PostgreSQL performance*: Similar with MySQL Performance dashboard, but for
  Postgres.

* *Thrift-RPC performance*: This one is great for monitoring Thrift based
  services. It includes widgets like "Top slowest Thrift-RPC methods" or "Top
  Thrift-RPC calls with errors".

These dashboards are provided as examples, we recommend that you

to your needs.
