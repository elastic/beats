== Sample dashboards

In order to make it as easy as possible to get application performance insights
from packet data, we provide a few sample Kibana dashboards. The
dashboards are maintained in this
https://github.com/elastic/beats-dashboards[GitHub repository].

Load automatically all the sample dashboards in Kibana by following the TODO[steps].
