== Topology Diagram

We currently recommend using Kibana 4 together with Packetbeat. However, there
is one panel type that is not yet available for Kibana 4, namely the topology
diagram. This panel type is implemented in a fork of Kibana 3 that was never merged
(and never will be). When Kibana 4 will support plugins, the panel will be
re-implemented as a plugin.

This page walks you through the steps required to install the forked Kibana 3
version and load the Packetbeat dashboards for it. You can install it side by
side with Kibana 4.

=== Download the Kibana 3 Fork

Download the forked Kibana like this:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://github.com/packetbeat/kibana/releases/download/v3.1.2-pb/kibana-3.1.2-packetbeat.tar.gz 
tar -xzvf kibana-3.1.2-packetbeat.tar.gz
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Kibana 3 is a pure Javascript application running fully in the browser. It
doesn't have or need a sever side part like most web applications do. Instead,
you only needed a web server to serve the Javascript files and the static
resources. For example, you can use python to create a simple web server:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd kibana-3.1.2-packetbeat
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now point your browser to port 8000 and you should see the Kibana web
interface. It will probably complain that it cannot reach Elasticsearch, like
in the following screenshot:

This is because 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[CORS] is
disabled by default in recent versions of Elasticsearch, to respect the "secure
by default" philosophy. You can enable it by adding the following lines at the
end of your `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
http.cors.enabled: true
http.cors.allow-origin: http://localhost:8000
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Make sure to replace `http://localhost:8000` with the URL under which you
access Kibana up to the first slash. Restart Elasticsearch:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/elasticsearch restart
----------------------------------------------------------------------

And try again to access Kibana in your browser. You should now see
Kibana's welcoming page.

=== Load Packetbeat Dashboards

To load our sample Kibana 3 dashboards, follow these steps:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-dashboards-k3-1.0.0~Beta1.tar.gz
tar xzvf packetbeat-dashboards-k3-1.0.0~Beta1.tar.gz
cd packetbeat-dashboards-k3-1.0.0~Beta1/
./load.sh localhost
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In which you should replace `localhost` with the host of your Elasticsearch
server.
