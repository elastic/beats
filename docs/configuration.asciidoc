[[configuration]]
== Configuration Options

The Beats configuration file uses
http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax. The file consists of the following sections:

* <<configuration-shipper>>
* <<configuration-output>>
* <<configuration-logging>>
* <<configuration-run-options>>

[[configuration-shipper]]
=== Shipper

The shipper section contains configuration options for the Beat and some
general settings that control its behaviour.

Here is an example configuration:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
shipper:
  # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
  # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
  # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
  #name:

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.
  tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
  # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
  ignore_outgoing: true

  # How often (in seconds) shippers are publishing their IPs to the topology map.
  # The default is 10 seconds.
  refresh_topology_freq: 10

  # Expiration time (in seconds) of the IPs published by a shipper to the topology map.
  # All the IPs will be deleted afterwards. Note, that the value must be higher than
  # refresh_topology_freq. The default is 15 seconds.
  topology_expire: 15

  # Configure local GeoIP database support.
  # If no paths are not configured geoip is disabled.
  #geoip:
    #paths:
    #  - "/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat"
    #  - "/usr/local/var/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Options

===== name

The name of the Beat. If this option is empty, the `hostname` of the server is
used. The name is included as the `shipper` field in each published transaction. You can
use the name to group all transactions sent by a single Beat.

At startup, each Beat can publish its IP, port, and name to Elasticsearch. This information
is stored in Elasticsearch as a network topology map that maps the IP and port
of each Beat to the name that you specify here.

When a Beat receives a new request and response (called a transaction), the Beat can query
Elasticsearch to see if the network topology includes the IP and port of the source
and destination servers. If this information is available, the `client_server` field in the
output is set to the name of the Beat running on the source server, and the `server` field is set to the
name of the Beat running on the destination server.

To use the topology map in Elasticsearch, you must set <<save_topology>>
to true and enable Elasticsearch as output.

Example:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
shipper:
  name: "my-shipper"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== tags

A list of tags that the Beat includes in the `tags` field of each published
transaction. Tags make it easy to group servers by different logical properties.
For example, if you have a cluster of web servers, you can add the "webservers" tag
to the Beat on each server, and then use filters and queries in the
Kibana web interface to get visualisations for the whole group of servers.

Example:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
shipper:
  tags: ["my-service", "hardware", "test"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== ignore_outgoing

If the `ignore_outgoing` option is enabled, the Beat ignores all the
transactions initiated from the server running the Beat.

This is useful when two Beats publish the same transactions. Because one Beat
sees the transaction in its outgoing queue and the other sees it in its incoming
queue, you can end up with duplicate transactions. To remove the duplicates, you
can enable the `ignore_outgoing` option on one of the servers.

For example, in the following scenario, you see a 3-server architecture
where a Beat is installed on each server. t1 is the transaction exchanged between
Server1 and Server2, and t2 is the transaction between Server2 and Server3.

image:./images/option_ignore_outgoing.png[Beats Architecture]

By default, each transaction is indexed twice because Beat2
sees both transactions. So you would see the following published transactions
(when `ignore_outgoing` is false):

 - Beat1: t1
 - Beat2: t1 and t2
 - Beat3: t2

To avoid duplicates, you can force your Beats to send only the incoming
transactions and ignore the transactions created by the local server. So you would
see the following published transactions (when `ignore_outgoing` is true):

 - Beat1: none
 - Beat2: t1
 - Beat3: t2

===== refresh_topology_freq

The refresh interval of the topology map in
seconds. In other words, this setting specifies how often each Beat publishes its
IP addresses to the topology map. The default is 10 seconds.

===== topology_expire

The expiration time for the topology in seconds. This is
useful in case a Beat stops publishing its IP addresses. The IP addresses
are removed automatically from the topology map after expiration. The default
is 15 seconds.

===== geoip.paths

The paths to search for GeoIP databases. The Beat loads the first installed GeoIP database
that if finds. Then, for each transaction, the Beat exports the GeoIP location of the client.

The recommended values for geoip.paths are `/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat`
and `/usr/local/var/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat`.

This configuration option is currently used by Packetbeat only.

*Important*: For GeoIP support to function correctly, the
https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/[GeoLite City database] is required.


[[configuration-output]]
=== Outputs

You can configure multiple outputs for exporting the correlated transactions. Currently the following output types are supported:

* Elasticsearch
* Logstash
* Redis (DEPRECATED)
* File
* Console

You can enable one or multiple outputs at a time. The output plugins are
responsible for sending the transaction data in JSON format to the next step in
the pipeline. They are also responsible for maintaining the
network topology.

==== Elasticsearch Output

When you specify elasticsearch for the output, the Beat sends the transactions directly to Elasticsearch by using the Elasticsearch HTTP API.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output:
  elasticsearch:
    # The Elasticsearch cluster
    hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]

    # Comment this option if you don't want to store the topology in
    # Elasticsearch. The default is false.
    # This option makes sense only for Packetbeat
    save_topology: true

    # Optional index name. The default is packetbeat and generates
    # [packetbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD keys.
    index: "packetbeat"

    # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
    cas: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

    # TLS configuration.
    tls:
      # Certificate for TLS client authentication
      certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

      # Client Certificate Key
      certificatekey: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable SSL, just add `https` to all URLs defined under __hosts__.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

output:
  elasticsearch:
    # The Elasticsearch cluster
    hosts: ["https://localhost:9200"]

    # Comment this option if you don't want to store the topology in
    # Elasticsearch. The default is false.
    # This option makes sense only for Packetbeat
    save_topology: true

    # HTTP basic auth
    username: "admin"
    password: "s3cr3t"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Elasticsearch nodes are defined by `IP:PORT`, then add `protocol: https` to the yaml file.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

output:
  elasticsearch:
    # The Elasticsearch cluster
    hosts: ["localhost"]

    # Optional http or https. Default is http
    protocol: "https"

    # Comment this option if you don't want to store the topology in
    # Elasticsearch. The default is false.
    # This option makes sense only for Packetbeat
    save_topology: true

    # HTTP basic auth
    username: "admin"
    password: "s3cr3t"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[hosts-option]]
===== hosts

The list of Elasticsearch nodes to connect to. The events are distributed to
these nodes in round robin order. If one node becomes unreachable, the event is
automatically sent to another node. Each Elasticsearch node can be defined as a `URL` or `IP:PORT`.
For example: `http://192.15.3.2`, `https://es.found.io:9230` or `192.24.3.2:9300`.
If no port is specified, `9200` is used.

NOTE: When a node is defined as an `IP:PORT`, the _scheme_ and _path_ are taken from the
<<protocol-option>> and <<path-option>> config options.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output:
  elasticsearch:
    # The Elasticsearch cluster
    hosts: ["10.45.3.2:9220", "10.45.3.1:9230"]

    # Optional http or https. Default is http
    protocol: https

    # HTTP Path at which each Elasticsearch server lives
    path: /elasticsearch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous example, the Elasticsearch nodes are available at https://10.45.3.2:9220/elasticsearch and
https://10.45.3.1:9230/elasticsearch.

===== worker

Number of workers per configured host publishing events to Elasticsearch. This
is best used with load balancing mode enabled. Example: If you have 2 hosts and
3 workers, in total 6 workers are started (3 for each host).

===== host (DEPRECATED)

The host of the Elasticsearch server. This option is deprecated because it is replaced by <<hosts-option>>.

===== port (DEPRECATED)

The port of the Elasticsearch server. This option is deprecated because it is replaced by <<hosts-option>>.

===== username

The basic authentication username for connecting to Elasticsearch.

===== password

The basic authentication password for connecting to Elasticsearch.

[[protocol-option]]
===== protocol

The name of the protocol Elasticsearch is reachable on. The options are:
`http` or `https`. The default is `http`. However, if you specify a URL for
<<hosts-option>>, the value of protocol is overridden by whatever scheme you
specify in the URL.

[[path-option]]
===== path

An HTTP path prefix that is prepended to the HTTP API calls. This is useful for
the cases where Elasticsearch listens behind an HTTP reverse proxy that exports
the API under a custom prefix.

===== index

The index root name to write events to. The default is the Beat name.
For example `packetbeat` generates `[packetbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD` indexes (for example, `packetbeat-2015.04.26`).

===== max_retries

The number of times to try a particular Logstash send attempt. If
the send operation doesn't succeed after the specified number of retries, the events are
dropped. The default is 3.

A value of 0 disables retrying and a value <0 will enable infinite retry until
events have been published.

If an event is dropped by the output plugin, each Beat implementation must
determine whether to drop the event or try sending it again. If the send
operation doesn't succeed after
max_retries, the Beat is optionally notified.

===== bulk_max_size

The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Elasticsearch bulk API index request.
The default is 50.

===== timeout

The http request timeout in seconds for Elasticsearch request. The default is 90.

===== flush_interval

The number of seconds to wait for new events between two bulk API index requests.
If `bulk_max_size` is reached before this interval expires, additional bulk index
requests are made.

[[save_topology]]
===== save_topology

A Boolean that specifies whether the topology is kept in Elasticsearch. The default is
false. This option is relevant for Packetbeat only.

===== topology_expire

The time to live in seconds for the topology information that is stored in
Elasticsearch. The default is 15 seconds.

===== tls

Configuration options for TLS parameters like the certificate authority to use
for HTTPS-based connections. If the tls section is missing, the host CAs are used for HTTPS connections to
Elasticsearch.

See <<configuration-output-tls>> for more information.


[[logstash-output]]
==== Logstash Output

The Logstash output sends the events directly to Logstash by using the lumberjack
protocol. To use this option, you must <<logstash-setup, install and configure>> the logstash-input-beats
plugin in Logstash. Logstash allows for additional processing and routing of
generated events.

Every event sent to Logstash contains additional metadata for indexing and filtering:

[source,json]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
    ...
    "@metadata": {
      "beat": "<beat>",
      "type": "<event type>"
    }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Logstash, you can configure the Elasticsearch output plugin to use the
metadata and event type for indexing.

The following Logstash 1.5 configuration file sets Logstash to use the index and
document type reported by Beats for indexing events into Elasticsearch.
The index used will depend on the `@timestamp` field as identified by Logstash.

[source,logstash]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    host => "localhost"
    port => "9200"
    protocol => "http"
    index => "%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    document_type => "%{[@metadata][type]}"
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the same configuration for Logstash 2.x releases:

[source,logstash]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    document_type => "%{[@metadata][type]}"
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Events indexed into Elasticsearch with shown Logstash configuration will be
similar to events directly indexed by Beats into Elasticsearch.

Here is an example of how to configure the Beat to use Logstash:
[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output:
  logstash:
    hosts: ["localhost:5044"]

    # index configures '@metadata.beat' field to be used by Logstash for
    # indexing. By Default the beat name is used (e.g. filebeat, topbeat, packetbeat)
    index: mybeat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[hosts]]
===== hosts

The list of known Logstash servers to connect to. All entries in this list can
contain a port number. If no port number is given, the value specified for <<port>>
is used as the default port number.

===== worker

Number of workers per configured host publishing events to Logstash. This
is best used with load balancing mode enabled. Example: If you have 2 hosts and
3 workers, in total 6 workers are started (3 for each host).

[[loadbalance]]
===== loadbalance

If set to true and multiple Logstash hosts are configured, the output plugin
load balances published events onto all Logstash hosts. If set to false,
the output plugin sends all events to only one host (determined at random) and
will switch to another host if the selected one becomes unresponsive. The default value is false.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output:
  logstash:
    hosts: ["localhost:5044", "localhost:5045"]

    # configure index prefix name
    index: mybeat

    # configure logstash plugin to loadbalance events between the logstash instances
    loadbalance: true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[port]]
===== port

The default port to use if the port number is not given in <<hosts>>. The default port number
is 10200.

===== index

The index root name to write events to. The default is the Beat name.
For example `packetbeat` generates `[packetbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD` indexes (for example, `packetbeat-2015.04.26`).

===== tls

Configuration options for TLS parameters like the root CA for Logstash connections. See
<<configuration-output-tls>> for more information. If the tls section is missing, a TCP-only connection is assumed. Logstash must also be configured to use TCP for
Logstash input.

===== timeout

The number of seconds to wait for responses from the Logstash server before timing out. The default is 30 (seconds).

===== max_retries

The number of times to try a particular Logstash send attempt. If
the send operation doesn't succeed after the specified number of retries, the events are
dropped. The default is 3.

A value of 0 disables retrying and a value <0 will enable infinite retry until
events have been published.

If an event is dropped by the output plugin, each Beat implementation must
determine whether to drop the event or try sending it again. If the send
operation doesn't succeed after
max_retries, the Beat is optionally notified.


[[redis-output]]
==== Redis Output (DEPRECATED)

The Redis output inserts the events in a Redis list. This output plugin is compatible with
the http://logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/inputs/redis[Redis input plugin] from Logstash,
so the Redis Output for the Beats is deprecated.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output:
  redis:
    # Set the host and port where to find Redis.
    host: "localhost"
    port: 6379

    # Uncomment out this option if you want to store the topology in Redis.
    # The default is false.
    save_topology: true

    # Optional index name. The default is packetbeat and generates packetbeat keys.
    index: "packetbeat"

    # Optional Redis database number where the events are stored
    # The default is 0.
    db: 0

    # Optional Redis database number where the topology is stored
    # The default is 1. It must have a different value than db.
    db_topology: 1

    # Optional password to authenticate with. By default, no
    # password is set.
    # password: ""

    # Optional Redis initial connection timeout in seconds.
    # The default is 5 seconds.
    timeout: 5

    # Optional interval for reconnecting to failed Redis connections.
    # The default is 1 second.
    reconnect_interval: 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===== host

The host of the Redis server.

===== port

The port of the Redis server.

===== db

The Redis database number where the events are published. The default is 0.

===== db_topology

The Redis database number where the topology information is stored. The default is 1.

===== index

The name of the Redis list where the events are published. The default is
`packetbeat`.

===== password

The password to authenticate with. The default is no authentication.

===== timeout

The Redis initial connection timeout in seconds. The default is 5 seconds.

===== reconnect_interval

The interval for reconnecting failed Redis connections. The default is 1 second.

==== File Output

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output:

  # File as output
  # Options:
  # path: where to save the files
  # filename: name of the files
  # rotate_every_kb: maximum size of the files in path
  # number of files: maximum number of files in path
  file:
    path: "/tmp/packetbeat"
    filename: packetbeat
    rotate_every_kb: 1000
    number_of_files: 7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file output dumps the transactions into a file where each transaction is in a JSON format.
Currently, this output is used for testing, but it can be used as input for
Logstash.

[[path]]
===== path

The path to the directory where the generated files will be saved. This option is
mandatory.

===== filename

The name of the generated files. The default is set to Beat name. For example, the files
generated by default for Packetbeat would be `packetbeat`, `packetbeat.1`, `packetbeat.2`, and so on.

===== rotate_every_kb

The maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, the files are
rotated. The default value is 10 MB.

===== number_of_files

The maximum number of files to save under <<path>>. When this number of files is reached, the
oldest file is deleted, and the rest of the files are shifted from last to first. The default
is 7 files.

==== Console Output

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output:
  console:
    pretty: true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Console output write events in JSON format to stdout.

===== pretty

If pretty is set events written to stdout will be nicely formatted. The default is false.

[[configuration-output-tls]]

==== TLS options

===== certificate_authorities

The list of root certificates for server verifications. If certificate_authorities is empty or not set, the trusted certificate authorities of the host system are used.

[[certificate]]

===== certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

The path to the certificate for TLS client authentication. If the certificate
is not specified, client authentication is not available. The connection
might fail if the server requests client authentication. If the TLS server does not
require client authentication, the certificate will be loaded, but not requested or used
by the server.

When this option is configured, the <<certificate_key>> option is also required.

[[certificate_key]]
===== certificate_key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

The client certificate key used for client authentication. This option is required if <<certificate>> is specified.

===== min_version

The minimum SSL/TLS version allowed for the encrypted connections. The value must be one of the following:
`SSL-3.0` for SSL 3, `1.0` for TLS 1.0, `1.1` for TLS 1.1 and `1.2` for TLS 1.2.

The default value is `1.0`.

===== max_version

The maximum SSL/TLS version allowed for the encrypted connections. The value must be one of the following:
`SSL-3.0` for SSL 3, `1.0` for TLS 1.0, `1.1` for TLS 1.1 and `1.2` for TLS 1.2.

The default value is `1.2`.

===== insecure

This option controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host names.
If insecure is set to true, all server host names and certificates are
accepted. In this mode, TLS-based connections are susceptible to
man-in-the-middle attacks. Use this option for testing only.

===== cipher_suites

The list of cipher suites to use. The first entry has the highest priority.
If this option is omitted, the Go crypto library's default
suites are used (recommended).

Here is a list of allowed cipher suites and their meanings.

* 3DES:
  Cipher suites using triple DES

* AES128/256:
  Cipher suites using AES with 128/256-bit keys.

* CBC:

[[configuration-logging]]
=== Logging (optional)

The logging section contains options for configuring the Beats logging output.
The logging system can write logs to syslog or rotate log files. If logging is
not explicitly configured, file output is used on Windows system, and syslog
output is used on Linux and OS X.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
logging:
  level: warning

  # enable file rotation with default configuration
  to_files: true

  # do not log to syslog
  to_syslog: false

  files:
    path: /var/log/mybeat
    name: mybeat.log
    keepfiles: 7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the logging system, the logging output configuration can be
modified from the <<command-line-options, command line>>.

==== Logging options

===== to_syslog

Sends all logging output to syslog if enabled. For non-Windows systems, the default
value is true.

===== to_files

Writes all logging output to files subject to file rotation. On Windows systems, the
default value is true.

===== level

Minimum log level. One of debug, info, warning, error or critical. If debug is
used, but no selectors are configured, the `*` selector will be used.
The default log level is error.

===== selectors

The list of debugging-only selector tags used by different Beats components. Use `*`
to enable debug output for all components. For example add 'publish' to display
all the debug messages related to event publishing. when starting the Beat,
selectors can be overwritten using the '-d' command line option ('-d' also sets
the debug log level).

===== files.path

The directory that log files are written to. For Windows
systems the default path is `C:\\ProgramData\<beat-name>\Logs`. The default for
non-Windows systems is `/var/log/<beat-name>`.

===== files.name

The name of the file that logs are written to. By default, the name of the Beat
is used.

===== files.rotateeverybytes

The maximum size of a log file. If the limit is reached, a new log file is generated.
The default size limit is 10485760 (10 MB).

===== files.keepfiles

The number of most recent rotated log files to keep on disc. Older files are
deleted during log rotation. The default value is 7. The keepfiles options has to be
in the range of 2 to 1024 files.

==== Logging Format

The logging format is different for each logging type. In case of syslog, syslog adds the timestamp itself.
For logging to file, the format RFC3339 is used which is `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00 WARN log-message`.
First is the timestamp with the time zone, then
the logging level. As logging to stderr should be mainly used for debugging, additional debug information
is added here. The format is `2015/11/12 09:03:37.369262 geolite.go:52: WARN log-message`. First is the UTC timestamp
with the milliseconds, then the name of the caller that sent the log entry followed by the log level.

[[configuration-run-options]]
=== Run options (optional)

The Beat can drop privileges after creating the sniffing socket.
Root access is required for opening the socket, but everything else requires no
privileges. Therefore, it is recommended that you have the Beat switch users after
the initialization phase. The `uid` and `gid` settings set the User Id and Group
Id under which the Beat runs.

WARNING: On Linux, Setuid doesn't change the uid of all threads, so the Go
         garbage collector will continue to run as root. Also note that process
         monitoring only works when running as root.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
runoptions:
  uid=501
  gid=501
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
