[[topbeat-getting-started]]
== Getting Started

Topbeat helps you monitor the availability of your website or service by providing system wide and per process
statistics along with a disk usage overview.

To get started with your own Topbeat setup, install and configure these related products:

 * Elasticsearch for storage and indexing the data. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#elasticsearch-installation[More details]
 * Kibana for the UI. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#kibana-installation[More details]
 * Optionally Logstash for inserting data into Elasticsearch. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#logstash-installation[More details]

After you have installed these products, you can start <<topbeat-installation>>.


[[topbeat-installation]]
=== Installing Topbeat

To download and install Topbeat, run the following commands. Use the commands that work with your system (deb for Debian/Ubuntu, rpm for Redhat/Centos/Fedora, mac for OS X).


deb:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/topbeat/topbeat_{version}_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i topbeat_{version}_amd64.deb
------------------------------------------------



rpm:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/topbeat/topbeat-{version}-x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -vi topbeat-{version}-x86_64.rpm
------------------------------------------------


mac:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/topbeat/topbeat-{version}-darwin.tgz
tar xzvf topbeat-{version}-darwin.tgz
------------------------------------------------

NOTE: We also provide 32-bit images that you can get from our 
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/topbeat[download page].

Before starting Topbeat, you should look at the configuration options in the configuration file, 
for example `/etc/topbeat/topbeat.yml`. For more information about these options, see the <<topbeat-configuration>>.

[[topbeat-configuration]]
=== Configuring Topbeat

NOTE: If you plan to use Logstash, you need to set up Logstash to work with the Beat before you 
configure Topbeat. For detailed steps, see {libbeat}/getting-started.html#logstash-setup[Setting Up Logstash].

To configure Topbeat, you edit the _topbeat.yml_ file. Here is a sample of 
the _topbeat.yml_ file:

[source, shell]
-------------------------------------
input:
  period: 10
  procs: [".*"]
-------------------------------------

The `period` option defines how often to read system wide and per process statistics from your servers. The interval is in seconds. 
By default, it's set to 10 seconds.

The `procs` option defines a list of regular expressions to match all the processes that need to be monitored. By default, all the running processes are monitored.

If you are not interested in monitoring your processes, you can use:

[source, shell]
-------------------------------------
input:
  period: 10
  procs: ["^$"]
-------------------------------------

[[topbeat-template]]
=== Loading the Index Template in Elasticsearch

Before starting Topbeat, you need to load the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html[index
template], which lets Elasticsearch know which fields should be analyzed
in which way.

The recommended template file is installed by the Topbeat packages. Load it with the
following command:

deb or rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/topbeat' -d@/etc/topbeat/topbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

mac:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd topbeat-{version}-darwin
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/topbeat' -d@topbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

where `localhost:9200` is the IP and port where Elasticsearch is listening.

=== Running Topbeat

Run Topbeat by issuing the following command: 

deb:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/topbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/topbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

mac:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ./topbeat -e -c topbeat.yml -d "publish"
----------------------------------------------------------------------


To verify that your server's statistics are present in Elasticsearch, issue 
the following command: 

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/topbeat-*/_search?pretty'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that you replace `localhost:9200` with the address of your Elasticsearch
instance. 

=== Loading Sample Kibana Dashboards

To make it easier for you to start monitoring your servers in Kibana, 
we have created a few sample dashboards. The dashboards are maintained in this
https://github.com/elastic/beats-dashboards[GitHub repository], which also
includes instructions for loading the dashboards.

You can load all of the sample dashboards automatically by following   
{libbeat}/getting-started.html#load-kibana-dashboards[these steps].

image:./images/topbeat-dashboard.png[Topbeat statistics]

These dashboards are provided as examples. We recommend that you
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html[customize] them
to meet your needs.

==== Example of a System Wide Overview

You can configure the `Dashboard` page to show the statistics for all servers or for a
subset. For example, you might have a dashboard page that shows:

* CPU usage and memory consumption for the top 10 CPU-consuming processes
running on different servers
* Free and used disk space for all servers
* CPU usage per process
* Memory consumption per process

image:./images/topbeat-dashboard-example.png[Topbeat Dashboard page in Kibana]

==== Example of a Per Server Overview

To display the statistics coming from a single server, you can use a search query like *shipper: precise32*:

You can learn more about Kibana in the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html[Kibana User Guide].


Enjoy!
