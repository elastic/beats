# Generating the Beat Index Pattern [generate-index-pattern]

The index-pattern defines the format of each field, and itâ€™s used by Kibana to know how to display the field. If you change the fields exported by the Beat, you need to generate a new index pattern for your Beat. Otherwise, you can just use the index pattern available under the `kibana/*/index-pattern` directory.

The Beat index pattern is generated from the `fields.yml`, which contains all the fields exported by the Beat. For each field, besides the `type`, you can configure the `format` field. The format informs Kibana about how to display a certain field. A good example is `percentage` or `bytes` to display fields as `50%` or `5MB`.

To generate the index pattern from the `fields.yml`, you need to run the following command in the Beat repository:

```shell
make update
```
