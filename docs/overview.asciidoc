== Overview

Packetbeat is a real-time wire data analyzer that can be used together
with the ELK stack to provide an application monitoring and performance
management system.

It works by capturing the network traffic between your application servers,
decoding the application layer protocols (HTTP, MySQL, Redis, etc.),
correlating the requests with the responses into transactions and recording the
interesting <<exported-fields,fields>> for each transaction.

It can help you easily notice issues with your back-end application, like bugs
or performance problems, and it makes troubleshooting them - and therefore
fixing them - much faster.

The system consists of the following mandatory components:

 * Packetbeat
 * Elasticsearch
 * Kibana


Packetbeat agents sniff the traffic between your servers, parse on the fly the
application level protocols and correlate the messages into transactions.
Currently, the Packetbeat agent supports the following protocols:

 * HTTP
 * MySQL
 * PostgreSQL
 * Redis
 * Thrift-RPC

The agents can insert the correlated transactions directly into Elasticsearch
or via a central queue created with Redis and Logstash.

Packetbeat agents can run on the same servers as your application processes or
on their own servers. When running on dedicated servers, they can get the
traffic from the switches mirror ports or from tapping devices. In such a
deployment, there is zero overhead on the monitored application. See
<<capturing-options>> for details.

After decoding the Layer 7 messages, Packetbeat correlates the requests with
the responses in what we call "transactions" and for each such transaction it
inserts a JSON document into Elastcisearch. See the <<exported-fields>> section
for details about which fields are indexed.

The same Elasticsearch and Kibana instance that are used for analysing the
network traffic gathered by Packetbeat can be used for analysing the log files
gathered by Logstash. This way, you can have network traffic and log analysis
in the same system.

Packetbeat can also insert the transactions in a Redis list. This makes it
possible to use Redis + Logstash as a central collector and queue for
transactions data. See <<packetbeat-logstash>> for details.
