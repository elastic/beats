== Overview

The _Beats_ are open source data shippers that you install as _agents_ on
your servers to send different types of operational data to
https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch]. Beats can
send data directly to Elasticsearch or send it to Elasticsearch via Logstash, which
you can use to enrich or archive the data.

_Packetbeat_, _Topbeat_, and _Filebeat_ are a few examples of _Beats_. Packetbeat
is a network packet analyzer that ships information about the transactions
exchanged between your application servers. Topbeat is a server monitoring agent
that periodically ships system-wide and per-process statistics from your
servers. And Filebeat ships log files from your servers.

If you have a specific use case to solve, we encourage you to create your own
Beat. We created an infrastructure to simplify the process. The _libbeat_
library, written entirely in Golang, offers the API that all Beats use to
ship data to Elasticsearch, configure the input options, implement logging,
and more.
