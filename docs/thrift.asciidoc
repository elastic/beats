== Thrift-RPC support

https://thrift.apache.org/[Apache Thrift] is a communication protocol and RPC
framework initially created at Facebook. It is sometimes used in
http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html[microservices]
architectures because it provides better performance when compared to the more
obvious HTTP/RESTful API choice, while still supporting a wide range of
programming languages and frameworks.

Packetbeat works based on a copy of the traffic, which means that you get
performance management features without having to modify your services in
any way and without any latency overhead. It captures the transactions from the
network and indexes them in Elasticsearch so that they can be analyzed and
searched.

Packetbeat indexes the method, the parameters, the return value and the
exceptions of each Thrift-RPC call. You can search by and create statistics
based on any of these fields. Packetbeat fills in automatically the `status`
column with either `OK` or `Error` so it's easy find the problematic RPC calls.
A transaction is put into the `Error` state if it returned an exception.

Packetbeat also indexes the  `responsetime` field so you can get performance
analytics and find the slow RPC calls.

Thrift supports multiple http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift[transport
and protocol types]. Currently Packetbeat supports the default `TSocket`
transport as well as the `TFramed` transport. From the protocol point of view,
Packetbeat currently supports only the default `TBinary` protocol.

The Packetbeat agent also has several configuration options allowing you to get
the right balance between visibility and disk usage / data protection. You can
for example, choose to obfuscate all strings or to store the requests but not
the responses, while still capturing the response time for each of the RPC
calls. You can also choose to limit the size of strings and lists to a given
number of elements, so you can fine tune how much you want to have stored in
Elasticsearch.

Here is an example configuration section for the Thrift protocol:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
protocols:
  thrift:
    transport_type = "socket"
    protocol_type = "binary"
    idl_files = ["tutorial.thrift", "shared.thrift"]
    string_max_size = 200
    collection_max_size = 20
    capture_reply = true
    obfuscate_strings = true
    drop_after_n_struct_fields = 100
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More details about the configuration options can be found in the
<<configuration-thrift>> section.

Providing the Thrift IDL files to the Packetbeat agent is optional. The binary
Thrift messages include the called method name and enough structure information
to decode the messages without the need of the IDL files. However, if you
provide the IDL files, Packetbeat can also resolve the service name, the
arguments and exceptions names.
