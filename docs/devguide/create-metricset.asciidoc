=== Creating a Metricset

A metricset is the part of a Metricbeat module that fetches and structures the
data from the remote service. Each module can have multiple metricsets. In this guide, you learn how to create your own metricset. If you want to create
your own Beat that uses Metricbeat as a library, see <<creating-beat-from-metricbeat>>.

When creating a metricset for the first time, it generally helps to look at the
implementation of existing metricsets for inspiration.

To create a new metricset:

. Run the following command inside your beat directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
make create-metricset
----
+
You'll be prompted to enter a module and metricset name. Only use characters `[a-z]`
and, if required, underscores (`_`). No other characters are allowed.
+
When you run `make create-metricset`, it creates all the basic files for your metricset, along with the required module
files if the module does not already exist. See <<creating-metricbeat-module>> for more details about the module files.
+
NOTE: We use `{metricset}`, `{module}`, and `{beat}` in this guide as placeholders. You need to replace these with
the actual names of your metricset, module, and beat.
+
The metricset that you created is already a functioning metricset and can be compiled.
+
. Compile your new metricset by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
make collect
make
----
+
The first command, `make collect`, updates all generated files with the most recent files, data, and meta information from the metricset. The second command,
`make`, compiles your source code and provides you with a binary called `{beat}` in the beat folder. You can run the
binary in debug mode with the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
./{beat} -e -d "*"
----

After running the make commands, you'll find the metricset, along with its generated files, under `module/{module}/{metricset}`. This directory
contains the following files:

* `\{metricset}.go`
* `_meta/docs.asciidoc`
* `_meta/data.json`
* `_meta/fields.yml`

Let's look at the files in more detail next.

[float]
==== \{metricset}.go File

The first file is `{metricset}.go`. It contains the logic on how to fetch data from the service and convert it for sending to the output.

The generated file looks like this:

https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/master/metricbeat/scripts/module/metricset/metricset.go.tmpl

[source,go]
----
include::../../metricbeat/scripts/module/metricset/metricset.go.tmpl[]
----

The `package` clause and `import` declaration are part of the base structure of each Golang file. You should only
modify this part of the file if your implementation requires more imports.

[float]
===== Initialisation

The init method registers the metricset with the central registry. In Golang the `init()` function is called
before the execution of all other code. This means the module will be automatically registered with the global registry.

The `New` method, which is passed to `AddMetricSet`, will be called after the setup of the module and before starting to fetch data. You normally don't need to change this part of the file.

[source,go]
----
func init() {
	if err := mb.Registry.AddMetricSet("{module}", "{metricset}", New); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
----

[float]
===== Definition

The MetricSet type defines all fields of the metricset. As a minimum it must inherit the `mb.BaseMetricSet` fields,
but can be extended with additional entries. These variables can be used to persist data or configuration between
multiple fetch calls.

You can add more fields to the MetricSet type, as you can see in the following example where the `username` and `password` string fields are added:

[source,go]
----
type MetricSet struct {
	mb.BaseMetricSet
	username    string
	password    string
}
----


[float]
===== Creation

The `New` function creates a new instance of the MetricSet. The setup process
of the MetricSet is also part of `New`. This method will be called before `Fetch`
is called the first time.


The `New` function also sets up the configuration by processing additional
configuration entries, if needed.

[source,go]
----

func New(base mb.BaseMetricSet) (mb.MetricSet, error) {

	config := struct{}{}

	if err := base.Module().UnpackConfig(&config); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return &MetricSet{
		BaseMetricSet: base,
	}, nil
}
----

[float]
===== Fetching

The `Fetch` method is the central part of the metricset. `Fetch` is called every
time new data is retrieved. If more than one host is defined, `Fetch` is
called once for each host. The frequency of calling `Fetch` is based on the `period`
defined in the configuration file.

`Fetch` must return a `common.MapStr` object, which is then sent to Elasticsearch.
If an error happens, the error must be returned and then is sent instead
to Elasticsearch. This means that Metricbeat always sends an event, even on failure.
You must make sure that the error message helps to identify the actual error.

The following example shows a metricset `Fetch` method with a counter that is
incremented for each `Fetch` call:

[source,go]
----
func (m *MetricSet) Fetch() (common.MapStr, error) {

	event := common.MapStr{
		"counter": m.counter,
	}
	m.counter++

	return event, nil
}
----

`Fetch` must return a `common.MapStr`, which will be translated to the JSON content.
The JSON output will be identical to the naming and structure you use in
`common.MapStr`. For more details about `MapStr` and its functions, see the
https://godoc.org/github.com/elastic/beats/libbeat/common#MapStr[MapStr API docs].


[float]
===== Multi Fetching
Metricbeat has two different `Fetch` interfaces. One of the interfaces, which you saw in the
previous example, fetches a single event. In some cases, every fetch returns a list of events.
Instead of using an array inside a JSON document, we recommend that you create a list of events.

For this kind of data, you can use the following `Fetch` interface:

[source,go]
----
(m *MetricSet) Fetch() ([]common.MapStr, error)
----

The only difference between this and the previous example is that the second example returns `[]common.MapStr`.
Metricbeat will add the same timestamp to all the events in the list to make it possible to correlate the events.

[float]
===== Parsing and Normalizing Fields

In Metricbeat we aim to normalize the metric names from all metricsets to
respect a common <<event-conventions,set of conventions>>. This
makes it easy for users to find and interpret metrics. To simplify parsing,
converting, renaming, and restructuring of the object read from the monitored
system to the Metricbeat format, we have created the
https://godoc.org/github.com/elastic/beats/libbeat/common/schema[schema] package
that allows you to declaratively define transformations.

For example, assuming this input object:

[source,go]
----
input := map[string]interface{}{
	"testString":     "hello",
	"testInt":        "42",
	"testBool":       "true",
	"testFloat":      "42.1",
	"testObjString":  "hello, object",
}
----

And the requirement to transform it into this one:

[source,go]
----
common.MapStr{
	"test_string": "hello",
	"test_int":    int64(42),
	"test_bool":   true,
	"test_float":  42.1,
	"test_obj": common.MapStr{
		"test_obj_string": "hello, object",
	},
}
----

You can use the following code to make the transformations:

[source,go]
----
import (
	s "github.com/elastic/beats/libbeat/common/schema"
	c "github.com/elastic/beats/libbeat/common/schema/mapstrstr"
)

var (
	schema = s.Schema{
		"test_string": c.Str("testString"),
		"test_int":    c.Int("testInt"),
		"test_bool":   c.Bool("testBool"),
		"test_float":  c.Float("testFloat"),
		"test_obj": s.Object{
			"test_obj_string": c.Str("testObjString"),
		},
	}
)

func eventMapping(input map[string]interface{}) common.MapStr {
	return schema.Apply(input)
}
----

In the above example, note that it is possible to create the schema object once
and apply it to all events.

[float]
==== Configuration File
The configuration file for a metricset is handled by the module. If there are
multiple metricsets in one module, make sure you add all metricsets to the configuration.
For example:

[source,go]
----
metricbeat:
  modules:
    - module: {module-name}
      metricsets: ["{metricset1}", "{metricset2}"]
----

NOTE: Make sure that you run `make collect` after updating the config file
so that your changes are also applied to the global configuration file and the docs.

For more details about the Metricbeat configuration file, see the topic about
{metricbeat}/configuration-metricbeat.html[Modules] in the Metricbeat
documentation.
