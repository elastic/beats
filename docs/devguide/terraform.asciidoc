== Terraform in Beats

Terraform is used to provision scenarios for integration testing of some cloud
features. Features implementing integration tests that require the presence of
cloud resources should have their own Terraform configuration, this configuration
can be used when developing locally to create (and destroy) resources that allow
to test these features.

Tests requiring access to cloud providers should be disabled by default with the
use of build tags.

=== Installing Terraform

Terraform is available in https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

Download it and place it in some directory in your PATH.

`terraform` is the main command for Terraform and the only one that is usually
needed to manage configurations. Terraform will also download other plugins that
implement the specific functionality for each provider. These plugins are
automatically managed and stored in the working copy, if you want to share the
plugins between multiple working copies you can manually install them in the
user the user plugins directory located at `~/.terraform.d/plugins`,
or `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins on Windows`.

Plugins are available in https://registry.terraform.io/

[[using-terraform]]
=== Using Terraform

The most important commands when using Terraform are:
* `terraform init` to do some initial checks and install the required plugins.
* `terraform apply` to create the resources defined in the configuration.
* `terraform destroy` to destroy resources previously created.

Cloud providers use to require credentials, they can be provided with the usual
methods supported by these providers, using environment variables and/or
credential files.

Terraform stores the last known state of the resources managed by a
configuration in a `terraform.tfstate` file. It is important to keep this file
as it is used as input by `terraform destroy`. This file is created in the same
directory where `terraform apply` is executed.

Please take a look to Terraform documentation for more details: https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html

[[terraform-configurations]]
=== Terraform configuration guidelines

The main purpouse of Terraform in Beats is to create and destroy cloud resources
required by integration tests. For these configurations there are some things to
take into account:
* Apply should work without additional inputs or files. Only input will be the
  required for specific providers, using environment variables or credential
  files.
* You must be able to apply the same configuration multiple times in the same
  account. This will allow to have multiple builds using the same configuration
  but with different instances of the resources. Some resources are already
  created with unique identifiers (as EC2 instances), some others have to be
  explicitly created with unique names (e.g. S3 buckets). For these cases random
  suffixes can be added to identifiers.
* Destroy must work without additional input, and should be able to destroy all
  the resources created by the configuration. There are some resources that need
  specific flags to be destroyed by `terraform destroy`. For example S3 buckets
  need a flag to force to empty the bucket before deleting it, or RDS instances
  need a flag to disable snapshots on deletion.

[[terraform-in-ci]]
=== Terraform in CI

Integration tests that need the presence of certain resources to work can be
executed in CI if they provide a Terraform configuration to start these
resources. These tests are disabled by default in CI.

Terraform states are archived as artifacrs of builds, this allows to manually
destroy resources created by builds that were not able to do a proper cleanup.
