=== Contributing to the docs

The Beats documentation follows the tagging guidelines described in the
https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/README.asciidoc[Docs HOWTO]. However
it extends these capabilities in a couple ways:

* The documentation makes extensive use of
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/conditionals/[AsciiDoc conditionals]
to provide content that is reused across multiple books. This means that there
might not be a single source file for each published HTML page. Some files are
shared across multiple books, either as complete pages or snippets. For more
details, refer to <<where-to-find-files>>.

* The documentation includes some files that are generated from YAML source or
pieced together from content that lives in `_meta` directories under the code
(for example, the module and exported fields documentation). For more details,
refer to <<generated-docs>>.

[[where-to-find-files]]
==== Where to find the Beats docs source

Because the Beats documentation makes use of shared content, doc generation
scripts, and componentization, the source files are located in several places:

|===
| Documentation | Location of source files

| Main docs for the Beat, including index files
| `<beatname>/docs`

| Shared docs and Beats Platform Reference
| `libbeat/docs`

| Processor docs
| `docs` folders under processors in `libbeat/processors/`,
`x-pack/<beatname>/processors/`, and `x-pack/libbeat/processors/`

| Output docs
| `docs` folders under outputs in `libbeat/outputs/`

| Module docs
| `_meta` folders under modules and datasets in `libbeat/module/`,
`<beatname>/module/`, and `x-pack/<beatname>/module/`
|===

The https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/conf.yaml[conf.yaml] file in the
`docs` repo shows all the resources used to build each book. This file is used
to drive the classic docs build and is the source of truth for file locations.

TIP: If you can't find the source for a page you want to update, go to the
published page at www.elastic.co and click the Edit link to navigate to the
source.

The Beats documentation build also has dependencies on the following files in
the https://github.com/elastic/docs[docs] repo:

* `shared/versions/stack/<version>.asciidoc`
* `shared/attributes.asciidoc`

[[generated-docs]]
==== Generated docs

After updating `docs.asciidoc` files in `_meta` directories, you must run the
doc collector scripts to regenerate the docs.

Make sure you
<<setting-up-dev-environment,set up your Beats development environment>> and use
the correct Go version. The Go version is listed in the `version.asciidoc` file
for the branch you want to update. 

To run the docs collector scripts, change to the beats directory and run:

`make update`

WARNING: The `make update` command overwrites files in the `docs` directories
**without warning**. If you accidentally update a generated file and run
`make update`, your changes will be overwritten.

To format your files, you might also need to run this command:

`make fmt`

The make command calls the following scripts to generate the docs:

https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/main/auditbeat/scripts/docs_collector.py[auditbeat/scripts/docs_collector.py]
generates:

* `auditbeat/docs/modules_list.asciidoc`
* `auditbeat/docs/modules/*.asciidoc`

https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/main/filebeat/scripts/docs_collector.py[filebeat/scripts/docs_collector.py]
generates:

* `filebeat/docs/modules_list.asciidoc`
* `filebeat/docs/modules/*.asciidoc`

https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/main/metricbeat/scripts/mage/docs_collector.go[metricbeat/scripts/mage/docs_collector.go]
generates:

* `metricbeat/docs/modules_list.asciidoc`
* `metricbeat/docs/modules/*.asciidoc`

https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/main/libbeat/scripts/generate_fields_docs.py[libbeat/scripts/generate_fields_docs.py]
generates

* `auditbeat/docs/fields.asciidoc`
* `filebeat/docs/fields.asciidoc`
* `functionbeat/docs/fields.asciidoc`
* `heartbeat/docs/fields.asciidoc`
* `metricbeat/docs/fields.asciidoc`
* `packetbeat/docs/fields.asciidoc`
* `winlogbeat/docs/fields.asciidoc`
