== Community Beats

The open source community has been hard at work developing new Beats. You can check 
out a few of them here:

[horizontal]
https://github.com/Ingensi/dockerbeat[dockerbeat]:: Reads docker container 
statistics and indexes them in Elasticsearch
https://github.com/mrkschan/nginxbeat[nginxbeat]:: Reads status from Nginx
https://github.com/joshuar/pingbeat[pingbeat]:: Sends ICMP pings to a list 
of targets and stores the round trip time (RTT) in Elasticsearch 
https://github.com/mrkschan/uwsgibeat[uwsgibeat]:: Reads stats from uWSGI
