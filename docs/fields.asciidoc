[[exported-fields-event]]
=== Event fields

These fields contained data about the transaction itself.



==== timestamp

type: date

example: 2015-01-24 14:06:05.071000

format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.milliZ

required: True

The timestamp of the event, as measured either by the shipper or by a common collector point. The precision is in milliseconds. The timezone is UTC.


==== type

required: True

The type of the transaction (e.g. HTTP, MySQL, Redis, RUM)


==== count

type: int

required: True

For how many transactions is this event representative. This is generally the inverse of the sampling rate. For example, for a sample rate of 1/10, the count is 10. The count is used by the UIs to return estimated values.


==== status

required: True

High level status of the transaction. The way to compute this value depends on the protocol, but the result has a meaning independent a meaning independent of the protocol.


==== method

The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, etc.), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).


==== resource

The logical resource that this transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL path up to the last /. For example, if the URL is `/users/1`, the resource is `/users`. For databases, the resource is typically the table name. The field is not filled for all transaction types.


==== path

required: True

The path to which the transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL. For SQL databases, this is the table name. For key-value stores, this is the key.


==== query

type: string

The query in a human readable form. For HTTP, it will typically be something like `GET /users/_search?name=test`. For MySQL, it is something like `SELECT id from users where name=test`.


==== params
