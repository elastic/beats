# Beats known issues [beats-known-issues]

Known issues are significant defects or limitations that may impact your implementation. These issues are actively being worked on and will be addressed in a future release. Review known issues to help you make informed decisions, such as upgrading to a new version.

:::{dropdown} Winlogbeat and Filebeat `winlog` input can crash the Event Log on Windows Server 2025.
**Details** 
On 04/16/2025, a known issue was discovered that can cause a crash of the Event Log service in Windows Server 2025 **when reading forwarded events in an Event Collector setup**. The issue appears for some combinations of filters where the OS handles non-null-terminated strings, leading to the crash.

**Workaround** 
As a workaround, and to prevent crashes, Beats will ignore any filters provided when working with forwarded events on Windows Server 2025 until the issue is resolved.

:::{dropdown} Filebeat's Filestream input does not validate `clean_inactive`.
**Applies to**: Filebeat < 9.2.0

The Filestream input does not enforce the restrictions documented for
the `clean_inactive` option, thus allowing configurations that can
lead to data re-ingestion issues.

**Fix planned in**: 9.2.0 by [PR #46373](https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/46373)
:::

:::{dropdown} Setting `clean_inactive` to `0` in Filebeat's Filestream input will cause data to be re-ingested on every restart.
**Applies to**: Filebeat >= 8.14.0 and < 9.2.0

When `clean_inactive` is set to `0`, Filestream will clean the state of all files
on start up, effectively re-ingesting all files on restart.

**Workaround**
- For Filestream >= 8.15.0 and < 9.2.0: disable `clean_inactive` by setting `clean_inactive: -1`.
- For Filestream >= 8.14.0 and < 8.15.0 set `clean_inactive` to a very
large value. For example, use `clean_inactive: 43800h0m0s`, which is 5 years.

**Fix planned in**: 9.2.0 by [PR #46373](https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/46373)

:::{dropdown} Beats panic on restart when "restart_on_cert_change" is enabled on Linux

**Applies to**: v8.16.6+, v8.17.3+, v8.18.0+, v8.19.0+, v9.0.0+, and v9.1.0+

**Details**
A known issue was discovered where Beats running on Linux with `restart_on_cert_change` enabled panic during a restart. This occurs because the default seccomp policy does not include the `eventfd2` syscall, which is used by Go runtime versions 1.23.0. While the initial launch is successful, subsequent restarts fail as the seccomp policy is already active, blocking the required syscall.

**Workaround**
Add a custom seccomp policy to the beat configuration file that explicitly includes the eventfd2 syscall. This custom policy overrides the default, so it must contain a complete list of all required syscalls.
