:::{dropdown} Winlogbeat and Filebeat `winlog` input can crash the Event Log on Windows Server 2025.
**Details** 
On 04/16/2025, a known issue was discovered that can cause a crash of the Event Log service in Windows Server 2025 **when reading forwarded events in an Event Collector setup**. The issue appears for some combinations of filters where the OS handles non-null-terminated strings, leading to the crash.

**Workaround** 
As a workaround, and to prevent crashes, Beats will ignore any filters provided when working with forwarded events on Windows Server 2025 until the issue is resolved.
