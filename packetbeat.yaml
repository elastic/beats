################### Packetbeat Agent configuration Example ######################

# This file contains an overview of various configuration settings. Please consult 
# the guide at <http://elastic.co/guide> for more details.

# Packetbeat is a distributed application monitoring that works
# by sniffing the network traffic between your application components.
#
#

############################# Sniffer ############################################

# The name of the agent that publishes the network data. It can be used to group 
# all the transactions sent by a single agent in the web interface.
# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
# sniffer.agent.name:


# The tags of the agent are included in their own field with each
# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.
# sniffer.agent.tags: ["service1"]

# Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
# by the server on which the agent is installed. This option is useful
# to remove duplicates if agents are installed on multiple servers.
# sniffer.agent.ignore_outgoing: true
 
# Select the network interfaces to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
sniffer.interfaces: ['any']


# Configure the processes to be monitored and how to find them. The processes can
# be found by searching their command line by a given string.
sniffer.procs: 
    - process: mysqld
      cmdline_grep: mysqld

    - process: pgsql
      cmdline_grep: postgres

    - process: nginx
      cmdline_grep: nginx

    - process: app
      cmdline_grep: gunicorn

# Configure which protocols to monitor and the ports where they are
# running. You can disable a given protocol by commenting out its
# configuration.
sniffer.protocols: 
        - protocol: http
          ports: [80, 8080, 8000, 5000, 8002]

        - protocol: mysql
          ports: [3306]

        - protocol: pgsql
          ports: [5432]

        - protocol: redis
          ports: [6379]

        - protocol: thrift
          ports: [9090]

         
############################# Filters ############################################

# Uncomment the following to hide certain parameters in URL or forms attached 
# to HTTP requests. The names of the parameters are case insensitive. 
# The value of the parameters will be replaced with the 'xxxxx' string.
# This is generally useful for avoiding storing user passwords or other
# sensitive information.
hide_passwords: ['pass', 'password', 'passw']


############################# Output ############################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by packetbeat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:
  
   # Elasticsearch as output
   # Options:
   # host, port: where Elasticsearch is listening on
   # save_topology: specify if the topology is saved in Elasticsearch
    - type: elasticsearch
      enabled: true
      host: localhost
      port: 9200

   # save_topology: specify if the topology is saved in Redis
    - type: redis
      enabled: false
      host: localhost
      port: 6379
      save_topology: true

    # File as output
    # Options
    # path: where to save the files
    # filename: name of the files
    # rotate_every_kb: maximum size of the files in path
    # number of files: maximum number of files in path
    - type: file
