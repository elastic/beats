# The ECS migration file contains the information about all the Beats fields
# which were changed between 7.x and 8.0.
#
# This file will be used to generate breaking change documentation and migrate
# Kibana dashboards. See script/renamed_fields.py and script/kibana-migration.py.
#
# The format of the file is as following:
#
# - from: <original-name-in-7x> # Field name in 7.x.
#   to: <new-name-in-8x>        # Field name in 8.0.
#   alias: <true|false>         # True if a migration alias exists in fields.yml.
#   beat: <beatname>            # Omit for libbeat fields.
