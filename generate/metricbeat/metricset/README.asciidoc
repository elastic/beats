own Metricsets.

=== Requirements

To create your own beat, it is required that Golang 1.6.2 or later are installed, the `$GOPATH` is setup correctly. In
addition it requires https://www.python.org/downloads/[python] and https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter[cookiecutter]
to be installed. More details on how to install cookiecutter can be found http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html[here].

=== Step 1 - Clone Beats repository

The first step is to clone the beats repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/elastic/beats $GOPATH/src/github.com/elastic/beats
----

After having cloned the beat repository into the `GOPATH`, change to the directory where you want to create the beat.
 This is normally under `$GOPATH/src/github.com/{your-github-com}`. Inside this directory run the command:

=== Step 2 - Create Beat

[source,bash]
----
cookiecutter $GOPATH/src/github.com/elastic/beats/generate/metricbeat/metricset
----

This will ask you some question about the beat name and path. Complete it accordingly.

=== Step 3 - Init and Create MetricSet

After having created the beat, change into the beat directory and run:

[source,bash]
----
make setup
----

This will do the initial setup for your beat and also run `make create-metricset`, which will ask you for the
module name and metricset name of your beat.
