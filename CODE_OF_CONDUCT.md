# Community Code of Conduct

Elastic is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone in
Elastic's Open Source Community, regardless of age, caste, citizenship,
disability, education, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, immigration
status, level of experience, neurodiversity, physical appearance or body size,
nationality, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, race, or religion
(or lack thereof). Our products are distributed by design, and with many
languages, perspectives, and cultures, it's easy to lose something in
translation. Respect cultural differences, and don't assume malice. We do not
tolerate harassment or discrimination in any form.

Please see Elastic's [Open Source Community Code of Conduct](https://www.elastic.co/community/codeofconduct)
for the full text of the code.
