      summary: Fix differential results using wrong data source for removed events
      description: |
        Fixed two bugs in osquerybeat's differential results handling:
        1. "removed" events incorrectly read from DiffResults.Added instead of DiffResults.Removed
        2. Simplified code by removing unnecessary intermediate variable and publishing results directly
