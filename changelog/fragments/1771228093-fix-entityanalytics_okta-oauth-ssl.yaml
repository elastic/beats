description: |
  The OAuth2 authentication flow in the Okta entity analytics provider
  was ignoring the user-configured HTTP client. Instead, it was using
  Go's default HTTP client for all token-related requests
  (initial token exchange, token refresh, and API calls).
  
  This meant that any custom TLS/SSL or proxy settings configured by
  the user were silently discarded, causing connection failures in
  environments that rely on custom certificates or proxies.

  This fix ensures the configured HTTP client is propagated through
  all OAuth2 token operations, so that outgoing requests correctly
  use the user's transport configuration.
