summary: Restore suppression of repeated channel-not-found open errors in winlogbeat eventlog runner

description: |
  Reintroduces channel-not-found retry log suppression that was lost during the eventlog runner refactor.
  The first channel-not-found open error is logged at WARN, subsequent retries are logged at DEBUG, and
  the suppression state is reset after a successful open. This prevents repeated WARN/ERROR log noise
  when a configured channel is missing.
