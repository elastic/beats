summary: Add amcache table and view specs and generated tables/view for osquery extension

description: |
  Amcache tables and the elastic_amcache_applications view are now defined by YAML specs
  (ext/osquery-extension/specs/elastic_amcache_*.yaml) with group amcache. Generated table
  and view code live in pkg/tables/generated/amcache and pkg/views/generated/amcache.
  Glue (generate funcs, view hooks, cleanup) is in pkg/amcache/register_generated.go.
  Unused methods and non-generated docs were removed.
