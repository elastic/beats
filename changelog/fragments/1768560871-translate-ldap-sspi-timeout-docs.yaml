description: |
  The translate_ldap_attribute processor SSPI bind could hang indefinitely when
  running under a local user account (which cannot obtain Kerberos credentials).
  This fix adds a 10-second timeout to prevent the hang and updates documentation
  to clearly explain which Windows account types support SSPI authentication:
  Local System, Network Service, domain users, and gMSA accounts work; local
  user accounts do not.

# Affected component; usually one of "elastic-agent", "fleet-server", "filebeat", "metricbeat", "auditbeat", "all", etc.
