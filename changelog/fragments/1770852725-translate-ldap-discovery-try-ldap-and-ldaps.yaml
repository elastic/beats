# Change summary; a 80ish characters long description of the change.
summary: translate_ldap_attribute discovery tries both LDAP and LDAPS per host, LDAPS first

# Long description; in case the summary is not enough to describe the change.
description: |
  When the translate_ldap_attribute processor discovers LDAP servers (via DNS SRV
  or LOGONSERVER), it now adds the alternate scheme for each discovered address:
  if LDAP is found it also tries LDAPS for that host, and if LDAPS is found it
  also tries LDAP. For each host, LDAPS is tried before LDAP to prefer TLS.

# Affected component; usually one of "elastic-agent", "fleet-server", "filebeat", "metricbeat", "auditbeat", "all", etc.
component: all
