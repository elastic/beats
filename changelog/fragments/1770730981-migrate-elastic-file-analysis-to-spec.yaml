summary: Migrate elastic_file_analysis table to osquery table spec and dedicated package

description: |
  The elastic_file_analysis osquery table (macOS) is now defined by the unified YAML spec
  in ext/osquery-extension/specs/elastic_file_analysis.yaml. Implementation lives in
  pkg/fileanalysis with generated table code in pkg/tables/generated/elastic_file_analysis.
  Registration is via the generated darwin registry; no behavior change.
