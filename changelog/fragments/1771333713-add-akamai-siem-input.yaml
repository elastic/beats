  Add a new dedicated Akamai input to Filebeat for collecting security events
  from the Akamai SIEM v1 API. The input uses EdgeGrid HMAC-SHA256 authentication,
  supports offset-based pagination, cursor-based checkpointing, concurrent
  worker-based event publishing, and automatic recovery when offsets expire or
  request timestamps become invalid.
