      summary: Fix differential results using wrong data source for removed events
      description: |
        Fixed two bugs in osquerybeat's differential results handling:
        1. "removed" events incorrectly read from DiffResults.Added instead of DiffResults.Removed
        2. Simplified code by removing unnecessary intermediate variable and publishing results directly

      summary: Add SSPI bind timeout and document Windows account requirements for translate_ldap_attribute processor
      description: |
        The translate_ldap_attribute processor SSPI bind could hang indefinitely when
        running under a local user account (which cannot obtain Kerberos credentials).
        This fix adds a 10-second timeout to prevent the hang and updates documentation
        to clearly explain which Windows account types support SSPI authentication:
        Local System, Network Service, domain users, and gMSA accounts work; local
        user accounts do not.

      summary: Fix Entity Analytics Okta OAuth2 token requests ignoring custom TLS/SSL configuration.
      description: |
        The OAuth2 authentication flow in the Okta entity analytics provider
        was ignoring the user-configured HTTP client. Instead, it was using
        Go's default HTTP client for all token-related requests
        (initial token exchange, token refresh, and API calls).

        This meant that any custom TLS/SSL or proxy settings configured by
        the user were silently discarded, causing connection failures in
        environments that rely on custom certificates or proxies.

        This fix ensures the configured HTTP client is propagated through
        all OAuth2 token operations, so that outgoing requests correctly
        use the user's transport configuration.
