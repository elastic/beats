This changelog is intended for community Beat developers. It covers the major
breaking changes to the internal APIs in the official Beats and changes related
to developing a Beat like code generators or `fields.yml`. Only the major
changes will be covered in this changelog that are expected to affect community
developers. Each breaking change added here should have an explanation on how
other Beats should be migrated.

Note: This changelog was only started after the 6.3 release.
