This changelog is intended for community Beat developers. It covers the major
breaking changes to the internal APIs in the official Beats and changes related
to developing a Beat like code generators or `fields.yml`. Only the major
changes will be covered in this changelog that are expected to affect community
developers. Each breaking change added here should have an explanation on how
other Beats should be migrated.

Note: This changelog was only started after the 6.3 release.

=== Beats version HEAD
https://github.com/elastic/beats/compare/v6.3.0..master[Check the HEAD diff]

The list below covers the major changes between 6.3.0 and master only.

==== Breaking changes

- The beat.Pipeline is now passed to cfgfile.RunnerFactory. Beats using libbeat for module reloading or autodiscovery need to be adapted. {pull}7018[7017]
- Moving of TLS helper functions and structs from `output/tls` to `tlscommon`. {pull}7054[7054]
- Port fields.yml collector to Golang {pull}6911[6911]
- Dashboards under _meta/kibana are expected to be decoded. See https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/7224 for a conversion script. {pull}7265[7265]
- Constructor `(github.com/elastic/beats/libbeat/output/codec/json).New` expects a new `escapeHTML` parameter. {pull}7445[7445]
- Packaging has been refactored and updates are required. See the PR for migration details. {pull}7388[7388]
- `make fields` has been modified to use Mage (https://magefile.org/) in an effort to make
  the building a Beat more cross-platform friendly (e.g. Windows). This requires that your Beat
  has a magefile.go with a fields target. The `FIELDS_FILE_PATH` make variable is no longer
  used because the value is specified in magefile.go. {pull}7670[7670]
- Outputs must implement String. {pull}6404[6404]

==== Bugfixes

- Fix permissions of generated Filebeat filesets. {pull}7140[7140]

==== Added

- Libbeat provides a global registry for beats developer that allow to register and retrieve plugin. {pull}7392[7392]
- Added more options to control required and optional fields in schema.Apply(), error returned is a plain nil if no error happened {pull}7335[7335]
- Packaging on MacOS now produces a .dmg file containing an installer (.pkg) and uninstaller for the Beat. {pull}7481[7481]
- Added mage targets `goTestUnit` and `goTestIntegration` for executing
  'go test'. This captures the log to a file, summarizes the result, produces a
  coverage profile (.cov), and produces an HTML coverage report. See
  `mage -h goTestUnit`. {pull}7766[7766]
- Beats packaging now build non-oss binaries from code located in the x-pack folder. {issue}7783[7783]
